In America, that which our nation's founders feared most is now taking place. In the span of mere years, authoritarianism has risen more sharply than ever in its history. The tide of despotism is no more stemmed for Americans' incredulity.

Thus, the present endeavor is undertaken with the aim of unearthing the true root of illiberalism and unfreedom. Contained herein is evidence establishing the facts of the matter, along with reasoned argumentation built upon its foundation. In this effort lies the hope that Americans can take proper and effective action in defense of the republic.
