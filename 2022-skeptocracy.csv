2022-01-02;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1477634329446649858;COVID;The left is screaming that we are in some new, more dangerous stage of the pandemic simply because COVID cases are way up, even though COVID deaths are down almost as low as at any point in the pandemic. If COVID is a highly infectious airborne virus, and humans are social creatures that must interact for modern economies to function, why haven’t we accepted that the virus will spread among us regardless of how strict public health control measures are? Why is the left obsessed enough with stopping the spread of COVID that it wants to force everyone to be vaccinated and shut down businesses, but not with stopping the spread of other deadly diseases like influenza or pneumonia? If cases are more prevalent, but they are also more mild, then why is the left acting like the pandemic is in its darkest days since before the COVID vaccines were released? The focus is clearly on the wrong metric: cases will happen, especially since the vaccine seems not to be effective against Omicron, but its deaths we have to keep under control. 
2022-01-03;https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/1478006717501763584;election;An audit of Maricopa county’s administration of the 2020 election revealed that, while the approved ballot stock uses an 80lb stock, ballots used as many as 10 stocks of differing weight. This in itself is not proof that the election was undermined, but that it well could have been—that fraud cannot be ruled out. When ballot paper stock is chosen for election security and yet ballots deviated from this stock, fraud must be at least suspected. And in an election, even the suspicion of fraud is unacceptable. If fraud provably could have happened, then how do we know it didn’t? And if we don’t know fraud didn’t happen, then how can we say that an election was legitimate? 
2022-01-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1478084512701722627;law enforcement;When black people are shot by law enforcement and media reports on the victim’s moral indiscretions, the left at least insists that all victims deserve compassion which shouldn’t be minimized by attacks on their reputation and at most that it is racist. But when a Trump supporter is shot then the left minimizes the tragedy by pointing out that they weren’t of impeccable morals. The double-standard is such that if a victim serves the left’s interests, then you are evil and heartless to point out that they weren’t the best person, but if the victim opposes the left’s interests, then it’s OK to point out the victim’s flaws. 
2022-01-04;https://www.axios.com/the-rise-and-fall-latinx-latino-hispanic-142d2a32-5b01-46f7-b680-76d0ea0928eb.html;identity;A prominent Latino groups is pushing back against (predominantly) the left’s use of the term Latinx to forcibly impose American leftist political dogma on Latino culture—imposition of culture, ironically, being something that the left claims to stand against. The Spanish language uses gendered nouns, and as any group would be toward their own language, many Latinos treasure and preserve the heritage of their language. Because of the left’s current obsession with gender-neutrality, leftists have devised the term “Latinx” to sanitize the Spanish language’s word which Latinos use to define themselves as a group, despite the fact that they overwhelmingly reject the contrived “Latinx” term. Ordinarily leftists recoil and condemn those who try to impose one’s culture on another. But when the left wants to impose its language policing culture on others, even those from a minority identity group which they claim to fight for, cultural dominance (what they doctrinally decry as “colonialism”) is suddenly not an issue they care about. 
2022-01-04;https://twitter.com/aaronsibarium/status/1478538279746252800;COVID;Yale students who are required to have full COVID vaccination and a booster, have been prohibited from even eating outdoors by the school. If the vaccine is so effective, why is Yale afraid of its vaccinated and boosted students eating outdoors, where COVID transmission is shown to be low? What is Yale afraid might happen? That these more-than-fully vaccinated students will catch COVID? And if they did catch COVID, are they worried cases will be severe, even though the vaccine manufacturers and public health experts have sworn that that’s nearly impossible? It sure doesn’t look like these school policy makers have much faith in the vaccine. 
2022-01-04;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4k9Ovt-nm8;COVID;According to computer modeling which has already proven accurate for SARS-CoV-2 predictions in the past, it is likely that the vaccination is driving the natural selection of coronavirus mutations that make it more infectious and less susceptible to prior developed human antibodies. Anyone who has taken high school biology could have told you that when an evolutionary pressure is applied to a species—like when vaccines are introduced to create antibodies for a specific mRNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2—it accelerates the natural selection of survival advantages. If there were no vaccines, coronavirus would have no pressure to evolve. There’s no reason to change what already works. But by introducing vaccines which help develop antibodies against a specific mRNA sequence for the virus, while the original strain of the virus without mutations will be quickly killed off, mutations that differentiate the virus from what the antibodies were developed for will thrive because they will not be recognized as easily. And over time, in a population of billions, these more resilient (i.e. mutated enough to be less recognized by antibodies) viruses will propagate more than the previous strain and take over. Finally there is sound scientific study, with a proven track record, that reinforces this fundamental biological reality in the context of COVID. mRNA COVID“vaccine” skeptics should fully expect to be vindicated in time when the model is borne out. 
2022-01-04;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2022/jan/04/joe-biden-coronavirus-omicron-variant-covid-vaccines;COVID;Biden claims that there is no possible reason why someone wouldn’t take the COVID mRNA “vaccine”—that Americans have “no excuse” not to do so—as though Americans shouldn’t be trusted to make their own medical choices for their own bodies based on their own unique health needs. It’s pretty outrageous that rhetoric like this is coming from a “my body, my choice” pro-abortion Democrat. The entire rationale behind abortion is that people have a right to choose what to do with their own bodies, even terminating a pregnancy. But apparently bodily autonomy goes out the window when the Democrats decree that a public emergency demands it. Whether you’ve developed natural immunity to COVID from an infection, or you are a young person or athlete who is fit and worried about suffering myocarditis as a side effect of the mRNA COVID jabs, or you have religious convictions which prevent you from using any product of fetal tissue (as the mRNA COVID jabs are), the Democrats don’t want to hear your excuses: they expect you only to fall into line and obey. 
2022-01-06;https://www.axios.com/obama-capitol-riot-democracy-greater-risk-27565770-2069-4fda-a4e4-1fecd923ef30.html;authoritarianism;In trying to drum up fear and a pretext to persecute the Democrats’ political opponents, Obama is alleging that democracy is in greater peril today, with Trump and his supporters allowing the Biden administration to wield presidential power with only token rhetorical opposition, than it was during the supposed “Capitol Insurrection”. If, in the Democrats’ thinking, January 6, 2021 was the darkest day of our democracy, when Trump and his supporters supposedly wanted to overthrow the government—which they could have done by sheer numbers but didn’t make even the slightest attempt to—then how are our days darker now, now that Trump’s supporters are going about their lives and not doing anything to threaten the stability of the government? How is America in greater danger now, with opponents of certain Democrat party lines banned from any meaningful presence on social media, than it was on the day of the Capital Riot? How is democracy in more peril now, now that Republicans are seeking purely peaceful electoral means of resistance to the Democrats (e.g. the groundswell of conservatives winning school board elections), than it was when rioters trespassed on the grounds of the Capitol? No rational person could conclude that, and yet the Democrats are insisting on this because they want to justify the ostracism and punitive treatment of their opponents. 
2022-01-06;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-59892937;authoritarianism;Biden claims that Trump tried to thwart the peaceful transition of power in spite of the fact that Trump had no hand in planning the Capitol Riot or the peaceful protest which preceded it—he merely spoke before those gathered for the latter—and in spite of the fact that the rioters did not so much as use any kind of lethal force against public servants, security personnel, or law enforcement. If the rioters in the Capitol on January 6, 2021 wanted to overthrow the government, why didn’t they? They certainly had the numbers to mount a coup, and if even a small fraction of them carried weapons into the Capitol building, they certainly could have carried out an armed seizure the building and all its occupants. And yet even so they did no such thing: they did not brandish lethal weapons, they did not use deadly force, and they left the Capitol of their own accord having not secured any change in government. They would have had to be the most laughably incompetent conspirators in human history to have sought a coup and yet not achieved it on January 6, 2021. Only Democrats, with their fawning, docile followers could believe such a ridiculous, contrived conspiracy theory as this. 
2022-01-07;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/omicron-spike-most-vaccinated-german-state-heralds-nationwide-surge-2022-01-07/;COVID;The state in Germany with the highest rate of vaccination in the country also has the highest COVID case rate in the country. If the vaccine was so effective, this should not be possible. If only the unvaccinated got COVID (which should now be utterly disproven by a mountain of evidence), this state would have the smallest population (proportionally) that could even get infected. In Germany, the unvaccinated are not allowed in indoor public spaces (with limited exceptions), either, so there is even less chance of the unvaccinated spreading COVID. So is it that the unvaccinated in this state are socializing significantly more than those in states with more unvaccinated people all without going to indoor public spaces, or is it that the vaccine isn’t effective? What is more likely? What fits the evidence better? 
2022-01-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1479852756676624387;COVID;While Trump was president and the Democrats wanted to paint him as negligent, hospitals tested every patient who came through their doors for COVID and considered any positive results a COVID patient, but now that Biden is in charge and Democrats want him to look good, hospitals have begun distinguishing between patients hospitalized for COVID and patients hospitalized for another reason with an incidental COVID positive result. What’s more likely: that the staff of a large majority of hospitals around the country were all too stupid to make the distinction between “hospitalized for COVID” and “hospitalized (incidentally) with COVID” when the pandemic began and didn’t realize their mistake for the entire last year of Trump’s presidency, or that they didn’t want to publish more detailed numbers so conservatives couldn’t make a counterargument? Regardless, what is now known where this data granularity is available is that only about half of those with COVID in the hospital were admitted due to COVID. It sure puts those claims of low ICU bed availability in perspective.
2022-01-08;https://thepostmillennial.com/border-patrol-increase-fentanyl-seized-south-texas;law enforcement;US border agents seized 1066% more fentanyl in 2021, Biden’s first year in office, than in 2020. This is stunning in itself, because Biden did not change many of Trump’s hardline immigration policies. This data is consistent with the massive increase in migrants Biden’s first year saw compared to Trump’s last year. What’s extremely telling, though, is that there are not 10 times as many migrants coming to the border, but yet there IS 10 times as much fentanyl being confiscated at the border. If the migration flow itself is any indication, the increase likely owes to the perception (though, clearly, not the reality) among migrants that Biden is more lenient on immigration than Trump. 
2022-01-09;https://twitter.com/drscott_atlanta/status/1480295777213857799 [archived];COVID;The head of the CDC just admitted that the COVID “vaccines” don’t stop transmission, and didn’t even claim in the same statement that they even REDUCED transmission. What more proof do people need that the vaccinated still spread COVID? And how effective is a vaccine if it still allowed the vaccinated individual to spread the disease for which they are vaccinated? Would anyone trust a measles vaccine if the vaccinated individual could still catch and spread measles? Of course not. By definition, a vaccine prevents transmission. That’s why the mRNA COVID shots aren’t vaccines: they’re experimental mRNA immunotherapies. More importantly, if the highest health authority in America admitted that the COVID shot doesn’t stop the spread, why are cities continuing to introduce vaccine mandate policies premised specifically on the notion that such policies would stop the spread? 
2022-01-10;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-10/why-shouldnt-we-dance-on-the-graves-of-anti-vaxxers;COVID;A column in one of America’s (historically) most prestigious newspapers is advocating that those who took the COVID mRNA shot jeer at and celebrate the deaths of those who did not. It is hard to think of more sickening conduct to encourage in our society. And such behavior, already present at a small scale, would only reinforce the fact that the “unvaccinated” are treated as second-class citizens in their own country. How can anyone who behaves this way seriously contend that they have right on their side? How could anyone who truly DID have right on their side stomach such repulsive behavior?
2022-01-11;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/repeat-booster-shots-risk-overloading-immune-system-ema-says;COVID;Drug regulators in the EU are saying that taking COVID shot boosters every 4 months could weaken the immune system. This makes logical intuitive sense, as the mRNA shot submits instructions to every human cell uses its cellular molecular resources to make COVID spike proteins. The body then reacts adversely to these spike proteins and generates antibodies. Essentially, this would mean that to take a booster every 4 months would be, from the immune system’s perspective, to attack the body every 4 months. This would almost certainly fatigue the immune system, just as being sick with the flu every 4 months would be. We also know that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins are cytotoxic, including those manufactured by cells at the behest of the mRNA it receives from the COVID shots. This gradual exhaustion of the immune system may well counteract any benefit that priming it against COVID (using its intended mechanism) would provide. 
2022-01-11;https://www.axios.com/justice-department-domestic-terrorism-unit-1a025d5e-09d1-46ca-ac77-cc60ca687d1b.html;authoritarianism;Days after the 1-year anniversary of the “Insurrection” of January 6, 2021, the federal government has announced its intention to form an anti-domestic terrorism unit, opening the door to untold abuses which will almost assuredly visit the political right first. As the War On Terror has amply proven, terrorism provides the government with a pretext to dispense with the normal, constitutionally mandated legal protections that the accused enjoy. For example, while criminal suspects must be charged with a crime to be detained, terror suspects can be detained indefinitely without charge, as those interned at Guantanamo Bay know too well. Criminal suspects are also constitutionally protected against arbitrary search and seizure without a warrant by the Fourth Amendment, but terror suspects can be readily spied upon with little court authorization necessary, if any. The timing on this proclamation was not a coincidence: publicized days after the 1-year anniversary of what Democrats are hailing as a right-wing attempt to overthrow the government, this prospective agency would go after the Democrats’ opponents first. Freed of the shackles of the constitution, this agency would persecute the right (or any who oppose the left) with abandon. And don’t believe the assurances of the Democrats that they are not trying to persecute the entire right, just the “extremists”. There is a reason why they are so casual with accusations of “white supremacy”. Opponents of racial favoritism toward nonwhites for monoclonal antibody treatment are being tarred as “white supremacists”, which is all that an “anti-domestic terror” unit would need to view them as a danger worth at least monitoring and at most apprehending. The same goes for opponents of the bias toward Critical Race Theory in many public schools, or of parents organizing to remove sexually explicit books from school libraries, or of advocates of voter ID bills. The list goes on. If anyone fitting these political alignments gets too impassioned about their cause, they just might get a no-fly list, or have their phone tapped, or have agents infiltrate their churches… the same treatment Muslims got (often unfairly) during the War On Terror. What the left, in its glee at the prospect of rounding up their opponents, forgets is that granting the government these powers is dangerous because it is nearly impossible to strip it of those powers, and those powers may well be turned on them in the future. Once the government uses its vast new domestic anti-terror powers against the left, then they’ll be sorry. But it will be too late. 
2022-01-11;https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/fda-head-omicron-is-a-natural-disaster-most-people-are-gonna-get-covid/;COVID;The head of the FDA flatly admitted that most Americans, implying the absence of distinction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, will catch COVID. This is the same FDA head stood by the mRNA vaccines for the last year because they were so safe and so effective. At best, this concession shows that the FDA as it currently stands is totally unfit to judge the efficacy of drugs that the government then pushes on citizens, and at worst suggests that the FDA was selling us a bill of goods when it pushed the vaccines and didn’t care. In spite of this admission, the agency CONTINUES to stand by the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, and has not spoken out against vaccine mandates which accomplish nothing save the ostracism of Americans who value their bodily autonomy. These comments invalidate every effort on the Democrats’ part to push the vaccine and punish those who decline it.

This is the same Biden who claimed he was better for the economy, and whose loyal party allies ensured the destruction of the economy under Trump (so he would lose to Biden) by locking down their states.
2022-01-13;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/01/13/more-than-2-in-3-chicagoans-feel-unsafe-in-their-own-neighborhoods-chicago-index-survey-finds/;law enforcement;More than 2/3 of Chicago residents, who are overwhelmingly politically left and thus likely supported the Defund the Police movement, now feel that their neighborhoods aren’t safe. Again, because these liberal residents threw a fit any time a black person was harmed by the police for any reason, the police pulled back to appease them and now criminals are running amok knowing no one will dare to stop them. It’s an incentive structure so simple a 9-year-old could have explained that this would happen. And yet now the same leftists who made their city unsafe have the nerve to complain about it? The richest irony is that the crime that their policies enabled are hurting racial minorities the hardest, and making their neighborhoods the most dangerous. 
2022-01-13;https://www.axios.com/supreme-court-biden-covid-vaccine-mandate-1dc48f8a-1f37-4af1-aecd-0f6625afd5c4.html;authoritarianism;The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to use OSHA to coerce companies into requiring their employees to be vaccinated. In a nation founded on the ideals of individual liberty and the sovereignty of the states, this is the only just and prudent outcome. It is dangerous to accord any president the right to make companies push medical treatments on employees, and alarming that the Democrats (via Biden) tried to do so—the fact that Biden even attempted this should have alarmed labor rights activists but, of course, being overwhelmingly Democrats, they cheered this. We are a nation of laws, laws which bind even the president. Even if every American supported the OSHA vaccine mandates, the law clearly does not empower the president to wield it as such. If such power is desired, appropriate laws must be passed. But that is just how badly the Democrats want to control Americans: they are willing to run roughshod over our checks on executive power to do so.
2022-01-13;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1481623239038275584;COVID;In Minneapolis, vaccine mandates are being enforced using executive emergency powers approved in March of 2020 and never revoked. If the vaccines are so effective and available to everyone, why do cities and states still need emergency powers to combat the virus? Shouldn’t these powers be relinquished? Does anyone expect these powers to be voluntarily forfeit, at any point in the future, given how long executives in cities and states have retained them? And which party is wielding these emergency powers to impose medical compliance requirements on their jurisdictions? It is exclusively officials belonging to the Democratic Party. 
2022-01-13;https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-demands-that-social-media-companies-censor;authoritarianism;Biden has directed private social media companies to censor what his administration deems to be disinformation, so that they can sidestep the First Amendment violation which would ensue if his administration did so itself. As Greenwald shrewdly pointed out, the Supreme Court has ruled in the past that the government implicitly threatening private companies to carry out censorship which it cannot is itself a First Amendment violation. This makes sense: what use would the First Amendment be if the government could just ask companies to censor people instead of doing so directly? Biden has already appointed regulators who are threatening to break up Big Tech monopolies, so social media has good reason to believe that complying with the censorship requests would make them less likely to be targets of the Biden administration’s antitrust suits. How, then, can anyone justify this? 
2022-01-15;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cdc-isolation-testing-omicron-1bea8a40-15d1-44d5-a429-2d1864840c96.html;COVID;Even public health experts are skeptical about the CDC’s new guidance that those with asymptomatic COVID infections can end their self-quarantine after 5 days. When even other experts who have been in lockstep with the CDC until now are criticizing its guidance, it is clear that the CDC has no more credibility on which to base its guidance. 
2022-01-15;https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/jan_2022/covid_19_democratic_voters_support_harsh_measures_against_unvaccinated;COVID;Almost 3 in 5 self-identified Democrats believe that the unvaccinated should not not be allowed to leave their homes, and 45% of them believe that the unvaccinated should be put in concentration camps. There is no other word for this mindset than fascist. As should not need to be said at this point, given the CDC director’s own admission, but it bears repeating: the vaccinated and unvaccinated spread COVID at the same rate. This means that these policies, in addition to being authoritarian and totalitarian on their face, also have no basis in epidemiological fact. 
2022-01-16;https://thepostmillennial.com/msnbc-contributor-calls-the-gop-a-front-for-a-terrorist-movement;authoritarianism;A panelist on MSNBC characterized the Republican Party as a “front for a terrorist movement”, which directly and thinly implies that he believes that the GOP should be outlawed. Terrorists are criminals of the most dangerous kind, law enforcement should act on criminals (from most to least dangerous), ergo anything designated as “terrorist” should be criminalized. The Republicans aren’t the ones who are trying to impose federal election standards on all states in blatant disregard for state sovereignty. The Republicans aren’t the ones directing social media to censor anyone who questions the mRNA COVID “vaccine” (under thinly veiled threat of regulation). The Republicans don’t enjoy the support of an armed group that sets fire to federal buildings, starts firefights in the street, and seizes city blocks to turn into lawless zones. The Republicans aren’t the party where almost half its membership wants to put the unvaccinated in concentration camps (and lest a Democrat apologist point to Trump’s policy of detaining migrants, recall that Biden is doing the same thing but at even higher rates then Trump). So if anyone party is a front for terrorists (IF, which is not to say that it is), it would be the Democratic Party. 
2022-01-17;https://twitter.com/0rf/status/1483162321191149574;COVID;Data from Israel shows that a 4th dose of the Pfizer mRNA COVID “vaccine” offers almost no more protection against the Omicron variant of COVID than a 3rd dose—since even 3 doses still wasn’t enough to prevent many vaccinated people from getting COVID, this means that the vaccines don’t work. The “vaccine” may have been effective against the “wild type” (i.e. original), but if 3 doses won’t prevent infection and 4 is barely any better, the vaccinated have no more recourse. There’s nowhere left to go, and the virus will only continue to mutate to evade the vaccine for as long as people continue to take more doses of it. 
2022-01-18;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnMMYJKZvnU;COVID;In a candid interview, Dr. Cyrille Cohen, one of Israel’s top immunologists and a member of the Israeli government’s vaccine advisory committee, noted that (1) the Omicron wave will not be over until everyone—regardless of vaccination—has sustained an Omicron infection, (2) schools should have never been closed at any point during the COVID pandemic, and (3) testing for all individuals—again, regardless of vaccination—is much more effective at reducing the spread of Omicron than requiring patrons of indoor businesses to show proof of vaccination (referred to in Israel as “green passes”). All of this eminently rational, borne out by ample available evidence. In spite of this, though, Democrat-controlled American cities continue to impose vaccine mandates to stop the spread of Omicron, with Boston being the most recent example as of this writing. There is also no indication that any jurisdictions in the US will impose testing requirements in lieu of vaccine mandates, though this could be because of limited test availability and processing capacity. Even so, such commonsense measures are not even being entertained in the US, certainly not by Democrats, despite their vocal claims to “follow the science”. What more evidence does one need that Democrat-imposed vaccine mandates are not about public health but demanding submission to the state (controlled by Democrats, of course)?
2022-01-19;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1483907335181455369, https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1485961964044095496;authoritarianism;Democrat supporters are now calling for Tucker Carlson to be imprisoned for making a rational case against going to war with Russia to defend Ukraine. Reasonable people can disagree about whether or not to intervene in Russia’s impending (by Biden’s own admission) invasion of Ukraine. There are sound arguments for either side of the issue. But because the consensus Democrat talking point is that we should go to war with Russia—despite the fact that the Biden administration essentially said it would do nothing more than sanction Russia—now the party’s loyal foot soldiers are calling for dissenters to be imprisoned as Russian collaborators and traitors. This should alarm every American. It is outrageous to label as treasonous the making of a case that would spare American lives and tax dollars which also happens to benefit a hostile foreign power. Or does this stem from Democrat supporters’ desire to believe the demonstrable fiction that the Republican party is an ally of Russia? It would certainly be strange for the party whose last president (Trump) was targeted by a hoax accusation of collusion with Russia and who saw no major Russian incursions into foreign states to be pro-Russian, and not the party who saw a Russian incursion during the administration of their last president (Obama) and is about to see another one under their current president (Biden) all while dropping opposition to a major Russian pipeline to Germany. But psychological projection is the archetypal Democrat pathology: the Democrats accuse their opponents of what they themselves are guilty of. Democrats were lukewarm at best on the last round of sanctions against Russia, and gave Putin a huge boon by dropping opposition to a Russia-Germany oil pipeline that will bring windfall revenue to Russia. But then they turn around and accuse the Republicans, who pushed for the same sanctions Democrats largely didn’t support, of being soft on Russia. As a good rule of thumb, if the Democrats accuse their opponents of something, there’s a good chance they’re guilty of that same accusation—the more vociferous the condemnation, the more hypocritically guilty they are likely to be. 
2022-01-19;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/mrna-boosters-don-t-block-omicron-south-african-study-shows;COVID;A study published in The Lancet suggests that even boosters of the mRNA COVID “vaccines” do a poor job of preventing infection. A reasonable person would typically expect something characterized as a “vaccine” to prevent infection, as traditional vaccines confer what is called “sterilizing immunity”, a complete resistance to future infections. But not only do the initial 2 doses not prevent mRNA shot recipients from getting Omicron, but a third dose doesn’t even do so. At this point, how can anyone who regards their critical thinking as rational and evidence-based argue that these vaccines are effective, even if they do in fact reduce the severity of Omicron cases?
2022-01-19;https://www.statnews.com/2022/01/19/those-who-recovered-from-covid-19-were-less-likely-than-vaccinated-to-get-infected-during-delta-wave/, https://fox8.com/news/coronavirus/natural-immunity-was-more-effective-than-vaccines-alone-against-delta-variant-cdc-study-shows/;COVID;Data shows that those who contracted and recovered from COVID were more likely to avoid an infection with the Delta variant than those who were “vaccinated” using the mRNA COVID shots. It bears repeating that anyone with a high school biology education could have reasoned this to be the case. An immune system which has successfully fended off a real COVID infection will be far more robust than one which only created antibodies from the mRNA-derived spike proteins. This is because the real virus kills human cells and replicates virally, and so the immune system must respond faster to limit the spread, whereas the disembodied spike proteins created from the mRNA “vaccines” neither replicate nor directly kill cells. This being the case, why doesn’t every vaccine mandate have a carve-out for proof of natural immunity? Shouldn’t those with natural immunity be exempt from COVID vaccine requirements, since they’re better protected anyway? Such a policy would not lend itself to the real goal of the vaccine mandates (which, one should recall, are only pushed by Democrats), which is to demand citizens’ obedience to the (Democrat-controlled) state. 
2022-01-20;https://greenwald.substack.com/p/congresss-16-committee-claims-absolute;authoritarianism;The Democrat-run January 6 committee has appointed itself practically unlimited investigatory power, arguing that it is unconstrained by warrant requirements for investigating anyone at any time for any reason. The actions of this committee are worse than the House Un-Ameriacn Activities committee headed by McCarthy: instead of seeking out communist infiltrators to the US government, the January 6 committee is hunting down rioters who trespassed on federal property for 3 hours and inflicted no more harm than breaking a few windows and bruising a few police officers (all of which should be duly prosecuted, as every American should support). Worse, there is no reason why this committee couldn’t turn its prying eye into the affairs of anyone the Democrats can even tangentially connect to the riots on January 6. The unchecked actions of the committee open the door to future abuse at the very least, and signal the beginning of the de facto outlawing of the Republican Party at the very most.
2022-01-20;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60063594;election;As Biden stares down abysmal approval ratings and no end in sight for their main cause, inflation, he has already declared that the 2022 midterm elections may not be “legit”. If Trump had done this, he would be slammed by every major news outlet (since they all serve as free PR for the Democrats) and there would be protests in every major city in America. Part of his declaration hinges on the fact that Congress failed to pass his voting rights bill which, among other things, would institute a federal election authority to mandate how states must conduct elections, flouting states’ sovereignty to elect their representatives as they choose. It also makes unflattering implications that don’t exactly help Biden. If the US has had literally hundreds of elections over the course of its history, all of them held before Biden’s voting rights legislation, is he saying that all of those were illegitimate too because they didn’t adhere to his proposed voting legislation? Wouldn’t he, by extension, be saying that his own election to the presidency wasn’t above board? If not adhering to his voting rights measures makes an election suspect, then every election in the nation’s history has been suspect. And then a further implication is, if the Democrats are saying every election is suspect, what right do they have to condemn Trump for questioning the 2020 election? The Democrats themselves implied that every election ever held in America is not to be trusted. But at the same time they maintain that the 2020 election—in which they disregarded voting laws in several states to allow unverifiable mail-in ballots—was the most secure and trustworthy election of all time. This just shows how inconsistent, opportunistic, and stupid the Democrats are. When they’re on track to lose an election that is just under a year away, they’ll claim that no election has ever been trustworthy, but then when Republicans call their bluff and question the 2020 election, they backpedal and assert that 2020 was the most trustworthy election of all time. 
2022-01-21;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1484535272754884611;election;Pundit after pundit—dozens of them—have declared that if Trump, who won an election for president fair and square and who stepped down as president at the appointed date and time upon losing less than 100% fair and square, were reelected then democracy in America would collapse. It is pretty galling that the press, which on the whole sides with the Democrats at every turn, can proclaim that democracy will die if the Democrats’ most hated opponent wins a free and fair election. It is even more audacious that they do so as their Democrat friends take away peoples’ freedoms by enacting vaccine mandates and online censorship against anyone who questions the vaccines being mandated. How does anyone believe the blatant hypocrisy of a political party, via their steadfast press allies as proxy, saying democracy dies if their opponents win a democratic election? 
2022-01-24;https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1485703543046746118;COVID;The same people, the Democrats, who are screaming that states can’t require IDs to vote because it discriminates against non-white people have no problem requiring IDs to go out to eat or go to a gym and supposedly discriminating against this same minority group. This is because the Democrats have no principles, other than staying in power and controlling others by any means necessary. They have no consistency on matters of even the most deeply professed morality. They will say and do anything to justify wielding power over you and controlling you. They’ll condemn ID requirements as racist when it might possibly prevent their base from voting for them, but they will welcome IDs to cast out the unvaccinated as filthy second-class citizens despite the clear scientific fact that they pose no greater risk to spreading COVID than the vaccinated.

2022-01-24;https://youtu.be/4zGXX6kDPBs;COVID;Data from the CDC shows that not only is natural immunity many times more effective than “vaccine” immunity for preventing COVID, but having both natural and “vaccine” immunity is negligibly more protective than natural immunity alone. As anyone who took high school biology can tell you, the antibodies developed from fighting a real infection of COVID are more robust than those developed from just seeing spike proteins created from mRNA instructions, because the former can form as a response to any and all parts of the virus rather than just the spike protein. How is it we are only hearing about this now, roughly 2 years into the pandemic? Did the CDC really not think to study this until recently? Or did they not release it until now because they wanted to keep pushing the mRNA “vaccine”?

If the FDA is going to limit treatments because of poor effectiveness against Omicron, then how come they haven’t limited the mRNA COVID “vaccines”, which are substantially more likely to lead to dangerous side effects than antibody treatments? Is it because many of the FDA’s political patrons and allies own stock in Pfizer, and the “vaccine” is significantly more profitable than antibody treatments? Is it because many of the experts on the FDA’s advisory panel have financial and professional ties to Pfizer? Or is it because they just want to make sure Americans don’t use a safe treatment because it might not work? 
2022-01-25;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/osha-will-try-a-different-route-to-a-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses/;COVID;After its attempts to push a nationwide vaccine mandate that would sweep up most American workers were rebuffed by the Supreme Court, OSHA is trying to find a new way to compel Americans to get the COVID vaccine. What’s even more audacious about this is that, in the time between OSHA’s announcement of its first vaccine mandate and now, the evidence has surfaced that the vaccine does not stop the spread and does not stop vaccinated individuals from contracting COVID—no less than the FDA head tacitly admitted the former and the head of the CDC explicitly admitted the latter. So on what grounds does OSHA think it can push ineffective vaccines—ineffective at least for the variant we have now, regardless of how well they handled earlier ones—now?

It is hard to find clearer proof that the corporate media is squarely on the side of the Democrats, giving them a pass for offenses for which they pillory the Republicans. When Trump mocks the press, the press cries state repression, but when Biden does it, they’re in on the joke.

To Biden’s credit, he did the right thing in apologizing for his remark, a courtesy Trump would never have done. The issue, though, is not with Biden for making the distasteful remark about an adversarial journalist doing his job: the issue is with the press for going nowhere near to castigating Biden for it the way they did when Trump uttered the same words against a journalist.

Biden ran on fixing the pandemic economy that Trump supposedly produced, but which Biden’s Democrat allies in state governorships largely induced via draconian lockdowns in 2020, and now he is failing to deliver on his promises. This shows staggering incompetence: how ineptly must you be managing the economy if your party destroys the economy by legally forcing businesses to close and you can’t get it to recover just by lifting most (if not all) restrictions on business operation? The left obsessively insisted the Trump made Americans’ lives worse, but what is worse than the economy destroying Americans’ investments—including retirement investments—under his watch?
2022-01-26;https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-surgeon-general-suggests-joe-rogan-podcast-should-be-censored-big-tech-has-important-role-to-play;authoritarianism;Biden’s Surgeon General is encouraging tech companies to censor anyone who disagrees with the government’s official position, as if the government has any right to ask the private sector to censor their opponents for them. As noted previously, the Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional for the government to coerce a private company, via explicit or implicit threat of retaliation, to censor their political adversaries on their behalf. How much more corrupt and authoritarian is it that the bureaucrat under a Democrat president is pushing Big Tech to censor their opponents when Big Tech employees overwhelmingly donate to Democrats (versus Republicans), as publicly available FEC filings clearly show? And, of course, the biggest litmus test of all whether Democrats and their supporters would tolerate this scenario if the shoe was on the other foot: would the left accept it if a Republican presidential administration’s Surgeon General told Republican-aligned Big Tech to censor a liberal critic? Of course not, and they would be right to take that point of view—freedoms should be respected irrespective of political viewpoints.

2022-01-28;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-contact-tracing-public-health-omicron-61231b48-b17b-4455-aa6a-a0fbf8400678.html;COVID;Democrats have decided that, while they want to eject the unvaccinated from society to limit the spread of COVID even though the more numerous vaccinated spread it just as easily, they don’t want to bother with contact tracing, which actually DOES limit the spread of disease. Although certainly not a panacea, contact tracing does make a tangible difference. It allows infected individuals to contact those with whom they’ve been in contact so that those individuals in turn can isolate early, reducing the spread of COVID if they test positive, until they test negative for COVID. Vaccine mandates, on the other hand, don’t work considering that (1) the vaccinated spread COVID at the same rate as the unvaccinated, (2) there are more vaccinated people in most areas than unvaccinated, and (3) the vaccinated are less likely to get tested, since they have been assured (until recently) that the vaccine makes them invulnerable to COVID, than the unvaccinated, who are not only aware that they are at risk for COVID (and take appropriate precautions) but are in some cases under obligation from their workplace to test for COVID weekly (allowing for the detection of asymptomatic cases where the vaccinated do not). It is quite strange that the Democrats defy this line of reasoning considering that they profess themselves to be the “pro-science” political party—unless it was never about science or public health but merely about controlling the populace and punishing those with whom they disagree.

What message is this supposed to send to Russia? Sending mixed signals in the arena of international diplomacy can lead to misunderstandings with catastrophic consequences. If Russia antagonizes US troops because it calls the US’s bluff that it won’t intervene, US troops do take action when Biden assured Russia they would not, or any number of other miscommunications transpires, it could easily spiral into direct war between 2 nuclear armed states. What does Biden think America will get out of taking this colossal risk? 
2022-01-28;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1487164691772227586;authoritarianism;A passenger on a Spirit Airlines passenger was told to cover his mask because the tongue-in-cheek (and not at all profane) anti-Biden slogan depicted on it, “Let’s Go Brandon”, was “offensive” to the other passengers. It would be one thing if the passenger was displaying racial slurs on his person: in that case, fellow passengers could understandably take offense. But essentially the political speech of his mask was the equivalent of expressing “I don’t like Joe Biden”, which we SHOULD all agree should be tolerated even if it is at odds with one’s own opinion. But literally the other passengers bullied a passenger with whom they politically disagreed. During Trump’s term in office, many Democrat supporters proclaimed “Fuck Trump” and incurred few, if any, consequences. I dare anyone to produce evidence of a passenger being told to remove or cover clothing that said “Fuck Trump”. Robert DeNiro even uttered this phrase on network television during the Tony Awards broadcast and was cheered rather than condemned by mainstream popular culture. This is another example of the Democrat-constructed double standard: you can criticize Republicans with as vulgar language as you want, but you can’t criticize Democrats even in mild language. 
2022-01-29;https://twitter.com/AmyBeePhoenix/status/1487484029762945028;authoritarianism;Merriam-Webster quietly changed their definition of “vaccine” during the pandemic, such that it went from containing inactivated microorganisms and conferring “immunity” to simply “stimulat[ing] the body’s immune response”—a change in definition which just so happens to go from not characterizing the mRNA COVID immunotherapy injections to characterizing them as such. Why is Merriam-Webster so concerned that the mRNA injections are classifiable as “vaccines” when they do not meet the traditional definition of vaccine? What do they have to gain from calling the mRNA injections vaccines? And what’s wrong with these injections NOT being vaccines? If the mRNA COVID immunotherapy injections are safe and effective, why should it matter if they count as vaccines or not? The answer is the pharma companies, the government, or both determined that people would be more willing to trust in the safety of the mRNA injections if they traded on the trustworthiness that most people regard real vaccines as having. In other words, it’s a con: by calling something a vaccine that’s not, people trust it like they trust real vaccines, a move which pharma and/or government would only pull if there was some reason not to trust the mRNA COVID shots. 
2022-01-30;https://thepostmillennial.com/poll-americans-candidates-scotus;identity;More than 3/4 of Americans (76%) disagree with Biden’s promise to limit the field of Supreme Court justice candidates to 6% of the population (black women). It should not come as a surprise that a large majority of Americans want Biden to consider all qualified candidates for the Supreme Court regardless of their background. So the fact that he is explicitly eliminating 94% of candidates shows just how committed he is to radical left race politics (Wokeness). Also, how is explicitly using race and sex as a hiring determination not racist? What about all the qualified Latino men and Latina women who could serve on the court? What about all the qualified Asian men and women candidates? What about all the qualified black men? It should be clear to any thinking person that excluding them on these grounds—that they are not both black and a woman—constitutes illegal discrimination from the federal government. And yet not only is Biden proceeding with it anyway, but he has the nerve to say that this is actually to PROMOTE racial equality. How is it that supposedly just and fair liberals don’t see through this for the naked racism and sexism that it is?

Frontline doctors have been exhorting the CDC to study this for months, yet only now can news consumers find mainstream media outlets reporting on ivermectin’s promising COVID treatment potential. If doctors and public health authorities, as they claimed, wanted to pursue any and all routes to ending the pandemic as quickly as possible, how did it take this long to study ivermectin? Is it because the CDC just didn’t get around to it? Or is it because ivermectin is a cheap natural drug that competes with Pfizer’s and Moderna’s newly patented and expensive mRNA COVID injections?

There is an active effort on the part of the Democrats and their supporters to gaslight the “vaccine” skeptics by claiming that they never said the vaccinated couldn’t catch COVID. Here is ample proof that they DID say the vaccine prevents infection—they didn’t always claim all along that the “vaccine” simply reduced symptom severity. That notion is a fiction to cover for how wrong they were found out to be.

Meanwhile, thousands of small business owners lost their life’s work and endured economic ravages because of the lockdowns. And how many others suffered from drug addictions, depression, domestic abuse, and suicide because they weren’t allowed to leave their homes, go to work or school, or see their friends? Essentially, the lockdowns saved a minuscule number of lives while eroding the mental (and physical) health and financial well-being of many times the number of lives saved.

For instance, by August 14, 2021, the Biden administration hadn’t even directed Afghan allies to begin making evacuation requests to US personnel. A core component of Biden’s campaign was that Trump’s administration was “chaotic” and that he (Biden) had the experience to execute policy smoothly. How is this better than Trump’s policy execution? 
2022-02-03;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60239038;authoritarianism;GoFundMe froze the campaign for the overwhelmingly peaceful Freedom Convoy protest for no other reason than that they politically opposed it. GoFundMe is not opposed to hosting funding campaigns for political causes. Not only that, but they are transparently partisan, in favor of (of course) the leftists of the world. Apropos of the BLM protests in Kenosha which precipitated Kyle Rittenhouse’s self-defense shooting of 3 assailants, GoFundMe directly contributed $500 to an organization called Riot Kitchen. Riot Kitchen’s activities included, among other things, filling up gas cans for use during the violent unrest in Kenosha, for which some members were arrested. So GoFundMe sees no problem with contributing its own money as a company to riot agitators, but takes issue with truckers trying to support themselves while they practice peaceful civil disobedience to protect their right to bodily autonomy. 
2022-02-03;https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-linked-to-menstrual-cycle-changes-11643902386;COVID;A recent study found that the COVID “vaccine” may cause anomalies in women’s menstrual cycles, specifically lengthening the time between cycles. It should not surprise anyone that an immunotherapy which instructs cells to make organic compounds they don’t normally make—compounds which, recall, are cytotoxic—would interfere with the normal menstrual cycle. While cells make these compounds, they must expend cellular metabolic functions on it which they would otherwise dedicate to their normal operation. If cells have the same amount of resources but one more task to expend them on, everything slows down. This is biology 101. Is it any wonder that pregnant women are among the least vaccinated groups in America? Who knows what other second-order consequences the mRNA “vaccines” may cause but which have yet to be discovered?

Is Facebook claiming to know more about what constitutes medical falsehoods than the peer review panel at the BMJ, one of the oldest and most credible scientific journals in the world? What’s more likely, that Facebook has the facts and the BMJ doesn’t, or that Facebook is really just trying to push its favored narrative?

This essentially amounts to theft. Instead of automatically giving back all of the money, GoFundMe is keeping any of it that isn’t reclaimed within a certain window of time and giving it out to other charities which ostensibly align with their politics. Recall that GoFundMe is very clear on the bent of its politics—leftist—as evidenced by its direct contribution to leftist riot logistics outfit Riot Kitchen. What’s even worse is that the government can force a private company to shut down monetary contributions to an overwhelmingly peaceful demonstration by dissidents of the ruling regime. There is no other word for this behavior than fascist: the government is puppeteering the private sector into crippling the lines of financial support to their political opponents. 
2022-02-04;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/04/harvard-medical-professor-says-its-time-to-move-on-from-pandemic-.html;COVID;A Harvard professor has come out urging people who would have reasonably robust immune responses against COVID to go back to their normal lives and consider the pandemic essentially over. At this point, the overwhelmingly dominant variant (Omicron) is less lethal, and anyone who has been infected with it has natural immunity for at least the next 6 months. There is no reason these people should not be at liberty to go about their lives. Every day that people who are reasonably resistant to it don’t do so is another day in which they don’t earn a living, support their local businesses, go to school, and keep our society functioning.

Biden campaigned on getting the COVID under control, and stated that any president who presided over as many pandemic deaths as Trump did should not be president. So where are the calls from Democrats for Biden to resign? Why isn’t Biden taking responsibility for failing the benchmark that he himself set for a president’s handling of COVID? Apparently, the way the Democrats (and their media allies) enforce it, standards on how many Americans a president can see die on their watch only applies to Republican presidents.

Granted, it is sensible to drop mask mandates because the masks that most people use are not effective, as they don’t have a small enough mesh, and masks have been shown to have a number of adverse side effects like fungal growths. On top of Democrats’ insistence on an ineffectual policy, they claimed that science supported it and are now dropping the policy even though the science they cited didn’t change. It just shows how the Democrats don’t stand for anything, and will forsake even what they claimed to be life-and-death public health policy to win elections, now that even their own voters’ patience is wearing thin on masks.

It’s doubtful that it owes to the vaccine’s effectiveness, since case rates spiked in January 2022 and the largest ever share of the vaccinated contracted the Omicron variant. Quite the contrary, the only way Fauci could justify declaring the pandemic as in decline—which could very well be accurate—is that enough people developed natural immunity from the January surge in cases that there is ACTUAL, organic herd immunity in large swaths of the US population (especially in urban areas), both among the vaccinated and unvaccinated swept up in that surge.

How can Biden claim to “follow the science” and stand against “misinformation” when making a statement that is clearly untrue? The COVID shot is clearly no longer effective against Omicron, if it was ever effective against the wild type: the mere fact that there were more COVID cases when America was 60% vaccinated than when it was 0% vaccinated is proof enough. Add to this the fact that in January 2022 the unvaccinated weren’t allowed in indoor public spaces in the dead of winter in major cities like New York and Chicago, meaning the vaccinated overwhelmingly more so than the unvaccinated were even in any position to spread in the first place, cements the fact that the vaccinated drove the record high COVID case rates. How can a president who ignores these facts claim to speak for objective scientific truth?

Government action of this sort is solely the provenance of fascists. Only fascists would attempt to end a peaceful protest by rendering protesters unable to receive or access funds—essentially, make them financially destitute. The only thing worse would be to order police to fire upon the protesters. This isn’t about controlling violent elements. Like with every protest, there will certainly be at least some instances of violence, but these have been so rare with the Freedom Convoy that conventional policing techniques would be MORE than sufficient—this financial coercion isn’t for crowd control, but to end a political uprising defying the left-wing Canadian government. The Freedom Convoy protesters are 100% in the right, if not before then certainly that their own democratically elected government subjugates them with financial destitution.

As stated previously on this subject, what is more likely, that suddenly there is twice as much tolerance in society from Millennials to Gen Z (Millennial rate of LGBTQ identification is at around 10%), or that Gen Z is simply viewing the LGBTQ plus constellation of identities as a fad to participate in? Social tolerance does not change that rapidly, and individuals are born with the mental characteristics that predispose them to LGBTQ identities at consistent rates across time and space. In other words, to the extent that someone is “born” gay, lesbian, trans, etc., the rate of this happening does not change over time, any more than the rate of males vs. females being born (or at least conceived) can deviate from roughly 50/50. This shift in the youngest generation toward LGBTQ identities just so happens to coincide with the explosion in identities which require no lifestyle change or commitment (or at least explosion in public presence). For instance, being homosexual requires one to pursue sexual relationships with one’s own sex almost exclusively (as opposed to with the opposite sex, as is most prevalent). If a self-professed homosexual does not adhere to this lifestyle with consistency, it strains the very definition of “homosexual”. But declaring oneself, for instance, “genderfluid” does not require any lifestyle change: this identity is predicated purely on how one feels about oneself, and is permitted to change from moment to moment, passing whim to passing whim. So is it any wonder why more Gen Z identify as LGBTQ now that the plethora of lifestyle-agnostic gender identities burst into mainstream cultural consciousness?

This data, directly from Public Health Scotland, should alarm everyone. So why is the Scottish government hiding the data? Shouldn’t they be concerned with keeping the public safe, in which case they should give the public the fullest scientific picture they can? If they want people to make the best COVID-related health choices, shouldn’t they let people see the risks of taking the vaccine? There is no excuse for hiding data that contradicts the “the vaccines work” narrative. The only reason that a government is doing so is to hide the terrible truth. 
2022-02-17;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jvUMVDdogXE;COVID;Another social media platform has censored a study by a highly respected physician because it does not conform to the narrative that the mRNA “vaccines” are the only effective way to fight COVID. The study, published in the prestigious and highly credible Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), was removed from LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft. How is it that LinkedIn claims to know so much more about COVID than a world-renowned physician that it sees fit to censor a study by that physician published in one of the world’s leading medical journals? Or is it just that they didn’t like the study’s conclusion, which is that natural immunity to COVID is long-lasting? 
2022-02-22;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-extend-us-national-emergency-due-covid-19-health-risk-2022-02-19;COVID;Despite the fact that the nationwide surge in Omicron cases has subsided and the US has approached his vaccination targets, Biden has renewed the invocation of emergency powers. How does it even remotely make sense to seize emergency powers when the inciting incident to the initial declaration of emergency is DECLINING in severity? Such seizure of power is the provenance of fascists. Authoritarians must remain vigilant to maintain a constant pretext their extraordinary powers, declaring emergencies whenever possible. It seems Biden has done exactly this, even though large swaths of Americans now have natural immunity, as vaccinated and unvaccinated alike contracted the Omicron variant, from the January wave. 
2022-02-23;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1496627230671319046;economy;The Biden administration’s response to a question about rising gas prices is that it’s being caused by the “cost” of “standing up for our values” in Ukraine… despite the fact that the US hasn’t done anything in regards to Ukraine that would incur costs. A “cost” would be deploying troops to fight in Ukraine, or purchasing less gas from Russia. Neither of these steps were taken, though. In fact, the Biden administration explicitly stated that it would not reduce gas purchases from Russia. The only way that the war in Ukraine could impact our gas prices would be from the disruption in the petroleum market. But then how would suffering this fluctuation, as every nation would (since the petroleum market and demand is global), count as “standing up for our values”? This statement implies we are willfully incurring a cost unique to and associated with an action we are taking for Ukraine’s benefit, but we are taking no such action which would incur a cost specifically in the form of higher gas prices. So essentially, this is just a deflection away from Biden’s disastrous economic policies. 
2022-02-24;https://www.axios.com/wanted-inflation-scapegoat-79bd4280-d757-4bf1-a27f-ccce1e8f8a1d.html;economy;Instead of owning up to the fact that their disastrous economic policies have caused inflation, leftist Democrats are pretending that corporations just all decided on a whim to charge higher prices. While arbitrary price hikes across an industry are not unheard of—this is the definition of a cartel—this is rare and typically only happens in industries dominated by a monopoly or duopoly. Thus, the idea that all companies everywhere all coordinated and agreed to charge more for their products is laughable. Such a scenario is akin to a Prisoner’s Dilemma, where companies have no incentive to raise prices, because if they do and their competitor doesn’t, the competitor will enjoy more sales (since its prices are lower). This is why the supply-demand relationship has the single largest impact on pricing. Running up the national debt and printing more money are driving inflation, not collusion between all private sector companies across industries. Leftists are pushing this absurd conspiracy theory because (1) it deflects from their catastrophic mishandling of the economy, and (2) it erodes faith in capitalism so that these leftists can win over more supporters for socialism and communism. 
2022-02-24;https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1496990828404875266;identity;A prominent Democrat has called for ejecting Russian students from US universities, a policy which would be “racist” by Democrats’ own principles. A commonly held principle among Democrats is that any policy which singles out a race or nationality of people for an adverse consequence is racist by definition. As proof of this, Democrats would universally and vocally condemn a policy which ejected all Kenyan students from US universities. But because Democrats consider Russians “white”, it’s OK in their view to discriminate and revoke their privileges. This isn’t to say the policy has no merit—it could, depending on how, why, and under what circumstances it was implemented (e.g. ejecting Russians who study at universities researching military technology)—but instead to say that it is hypocritical of Democrats to say this. They can’t claim to be the party of racial justice and endorse views like this. 
2022-02-25;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-masks-cdc-guidance-52aaae87-7ea5-4a3b-8ebf-66e3f542ef77.html;COVID;Once again, the CDC has arbitrarily changed its masking policy due to the shifting winds of public opinion, in spite of there being no updates in scientific understanding of masking. Previously, the CDC admitted to dropping its first mask mandate to encourage more Americans to get vaccinated. Now that the nationwide Omicron wave has subsided and Democrat governors and mayors across the country are ending mask mandates in response to a sharp decline in public support for them, the CDC is following suit. All of this is intended solely to cushion the blow to Democrats in the upcoming election. There is no new evidence that the virus increased in size so that the most commonly used masks will obstruct it, and there is no new evidence that the masks most commonly used by Americans have a weave that’s now tight enough to obstruct the virus. So there is no evidenciary or scientific basis for the CDC’s change in guidance. Either its prior guidance was unscientific or its new guidance is. Given the physical properties of the virus and masks, it is likely that its new guidance is actually more reasonable. But that begs the question: why did they issue the prior guidance when the science didn’t support it? It would seem that this is purely “public health theater”, an attempt to create the illusion of taking concrete steps even though they have no impact on public health outcomes. 
2022-02-26;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/595919-62-percent-of-voters-say-putin-wouldnt-have-invaded-ukraine-if-trump;foreign policy;More than 3 in 5 Americans (62%) believe that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump were president. Such a strong majority means that even a fair share of independent and Democrat voters, and not just die-hard Republican voters, believe that Trump would kept Putin out of Ukraine. This just goes to show how weak Americans, even his own voters, perceive Biden to be. There is ample reason to believe that this would in fact have been the case. Obama and Biden, both Democrat presidents, pushed for the incorporation of Ukraine into NATO despite Putin’s warnings that Russia would regard this as an EXISTENTIAL threat. While Trump certainly opposed a Russian invasion of Ukraine, he did not push for its NATO membership. Instead, Trump beefed up NATO by pushing other NATO members to increase their monetary and personnel contributions to the alliance. But ultimately, the proximate cause for Putin ordering an invasion of Ukraine is the smell of weakness he got from Biden. Why? If, along with insisting on Ukraine joining NATO, Biden had come off as though he would deploy US troops to defend Ukraine, Putin would likely not have been willing to risk direct confrontation with the American military. So the fact that Putin DID send troops to Ukraine demonstrates that he didn’t think American troops would oppose him. Putin was right. Biden hasn’t sent troops, and at this point, it’s too late—Russia has pushed deep enough into Ukraine that US or NATO troops wouldn’t be able to turn the tide.

Not only is trust in the Biden administration on COVID diminishing, but it has dipped so low that the Democrat voter base is starting to lose trust. Biden campaigned as the president who believed in science, so how come he can’t get Americans across the ideological spectrum to trust his grasp of the science on COVID? It’s probably because over that time efficacy of the vaccine dropped significantly, so much so that many vaccinated people contracted COVID.

The Biden administration has rolled out a plan to use four-legged robots to patrol the border, which Latino Democrats have decried as dehumanizing to Latinos. What happened to Biden’s promise to treat migrants with dignity? Yet more proof that Biden doesn’t stand by any of his promises.
2022-03-01;MDPI: “Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line”;COVID;A study in a scientific journal suggests that the Pfizer mRNA “vaccine” can cause reverse transcription to DNA, which COVID “vaccine” apologists swore is impossible. The study, published in the MDPI journal, indicates that the mRNA sequences delivered by the vaccine can result in viral DNA fragments to be written to the human genome in human cells (in this case, liver cells). That this is even possible should be utterly alarming, but what is more shocking is that this is exactly what pro-”vaccine” public health officials all swore was impossible. These officials have been so consistently wrong about the science of the mRNA shots that either they are the least competent public health bureaucrats of all time, or they have deliberately suppressed and hidden all the possible adverse side-effects of the mRNA shot that are slowly emerging now. 
2022-03-01;State of Wisconsin, Office of the Special Counsel: “Second Interim Investigative Report On the Apparatus & Procedures of the Wisconsin Elections System”;election;A report submitted to the Wisconsin legislature by the state’s Office of the Special Counsel outlines a number of irregularities and possible criminal conduct in the state’s execution of the 2020 election. The report puts forward 8 instances of serious irregularities. Most notable of these are the use of absentee ballot drop boxes without prior legislative approval, city governments providing private companies with unauthorized access to the WisVote database, nursing home residents casting votes with improper assistance and when ineligible to do so, and failure to include non-citizen in the WisVote database so that they can be properly denied a ballot (in accordance with state and federal law). The fact that election law was clearly violated numerous times and in a variety of ways, at the very minimum, leaves the door open to election fraud. Not only that, but instances of ballots being cast improperly have been forensically discovered. Whether this was done on a scale sufficient to influence the outcome of the state’s presidential election is not currently known. Even so, Democrats can no longer truthfully state that such an outcome is impossible. Democrats’ claims that the 2020 presidential election constitutes the most secure election ever held have been thoroughly shattered. 
2022-03-07;https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2142739&HistoricalAwards=false;authoritarianism ;The Biden administration funded the development of an AI to censor users on social media. Biden is allowed to have his own personal views on what should and shouldn’t be said online. But as a public servant bound by the constitution, he has no business funding or furthering any initiative with the aim of censoring speech, even speech that most Americans would find offensive. The First Amendment protects even offensive speech, because to silence offensive speech opens the door to silencing any speech. This once was widely understood and acknowledged by civil liberties defenders, in the days when the ACLU would defend the rights of Neo-Nazis to march (in spite of how obviously repugnant their views are). The most central value of the Biden administration, and the Democratic Party, is authoritarianism. They want the power to silence anyone who disagrees with them, and they will seize this power by any means necessary.

How is it not the most authoritarian thing imaginable to punish your opponents for using the law to challenge the result of your election victory by ensuring they can never challenge you again? This is the behavior of tyrants. And it certainly suggests that the election was not so legitimate as these same Democrats claim. If a party’s reaction to being challenged on the outcome of a presidential election in court, under laws firmly on the books, and surviving the challenge is to prevent those lawyers from ever practicing law again, then what are they so afraid of? This is not the behavior of a party secure in the knowledge that they won fair and square. And because, by definition, “dark money” means that donors cannot be identified, it is entirely possible that the funders are Democrats themselves. We are reaching a dangerous place where anyone who wants a fair recount against a Democrat win will be ejected from the electoral and legal process. Despots the world over cling to this very tactic: cheat to win, then destroy everyone who cried foul. The Democrats have definitely engaged in the second part of this, and it is unknown if they have or have not done so for the first. 
2022-03-08;https://twitter.com/ConceptualJames/status/1501202423032995840;COVID;Biden’s Surgeon General, a government employee bound by the constitution and its First Amendment, has issued guidance to Americans instructing them to help censor social media content which constitutes “misinformation” in his view regarding COVID. Once again, it should be noted that the Supreme Court has ruled that the government laundering censorship requests through the private sector is unconstitutional. The government cannot twist the arm of private companies to silence Americans when government, itself, may not do so. Otherwise what’s the point of the First Amendment? It’s interesting that the Surgeon General is stepping up his censorship campaign now that evidence abounds that the mRNA shot is ineffective against Omicron. Does anyone watching this administration really think that this censorship regime will not target evidence-based claims that the “vaccines” don’t work against Omicron? So then what anti-misinformation purpose is really being served here? Or is it an anti-Biden-criticism purpose?

2022-03-10;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1502079894339084288;identity;Facebook has appointed itself the right to determine which nationalities users should be allowed to wish death upon, and which nationalities should be protected by their moderation policies. Facebook has exempted speech regarding Russians from its moderation policy against calling for the death of certain groups, in response to the Ukraine conflict. This is an extremely dangerous precedent to set, and one with no public oversight. Facebook is not a democracy on which all adults can vote. And as is well established from a view of FEC filings on campaign donations, the overwhelming majority of Facebook staffers support the Democrats. How does anyone think it’s OK to let a single highly partisan body to decide that certain groups should be subject to death threats? And of course, partisan bodies do enjoy such control, it is to the benefit of Democrats, as has been consistently the case for anyone gathering the evidence (at least when viewing the United States as a whole). The effect of this is that Democrat partisans, most of whom subscribe to the racist Critical Race Theory ideology in practice, decide who should suffer hate speech and who should not.

One of two things is clear: either Biden is deliberately pursuing policies which will jack up inflation and won’t admit it, or he is so incompetent that he has no idea how to stop it. Neither is acceptable, especially from someone who, as a candidate, claimed to have far superior understanding of the economy compared to Trump. 
2022-03-11;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jeff-zucker-cnn-resign-affair-cuomo-trump-1319698/;COVID;During the first months of the COVID pandemic, CNN colluded with a Democrat politician to help him improve his image and antagonize Trump. Gollust, the highest-level marketing and communications exec at CNN who previously worked for Andrew Cuomo, invited Cuomo onto CNN in order for him to respond favorably to pointed criticism by Trump. This is not mere conjecture. Text messages between the two, unearthed by a law firm in its review of CNN following Zucker’s scandalous departure, prove this to be the case. This incident yields yet more (and more concrete) evidence that the media is squarely backing the Democrats. This fact can no longer be denied. How is it, then, that the left is shocked that the right and independents no longer trust news which they know serves them (the left)?
2022-03-14;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1503468808094191618;authoritarianism;A prominent CNN journalist is calling for the FBI to investigate another journalist and a former politician for suggesting that the US had a role in heightening tensions between Ukraine and Russia, and thus precipitating the war between them. Aside from the fact that the First Amendment protects Americans from government prosecution, regardless of what views they choose to express, it is completely legitimate to interrogate the US’s role in fomenting the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The idea that this journalist is advancing is essentially that, if you don’t agree with the federal government’s assessment of blame for certain geopolitical outcomes, you should be imprisoned. This is an extremely perilous view, especially for a journalist with national viewership, to advance. How can a nation be free if citizens are imprisoned for challenging that government’s views, regardless of how widely held they are among the masses? If this bedrock freedom is eroded, true democracy becomes impossible, as a legal sword will hang over any dissenters.

Victoria Nuland, a member of the Biden administration, admitted before Congress that there are biological weapons facilities in Ukraine which the US has a hand in running. Yet when a critic of the president merely repeated this assertion, which in theory Americans have every reason to believe is true because it was uttered under oath, NBC labeled the claim as “far-right” “propaganda”. This is behavior befitting only despots: nominally independent, but allied, media entities refuting and condemning repetition of the regime’s own claims because they undermine the regime.

When the New York Post first reported on the emails contained on Hunter Biden’s laptop, media outlets rushed to characterizing it as Russian disinformation (or resembling it), and Facebook and Twitter (and likely others) prevented the story from circulating—censorship. Now a bastion of left-wing institutions, the New York Times, has finally conceded that it was true. This By definition, this means the suppression of the story constitutes election meddling by the journalistic and social media entities that participated in the denigration and suppression of the story, which could have swayed voters to vote for Trump had they been exposed to it. Is it any wonder why the right views the 2020 election as stolen? Would the left have viewed the 2020 election as NOT stolen had the media and social media suppressed a story critical of Trump and had Trump then won?

The Democrats accused Trump of being a pushover for Putin, despite the fact that Trump pushed to cancel the Germany-Russia Nord Stream 2 pipeline, advised Germany to end its dependence on Russian energy, and called for NATO members to dramatically step up their funding. But even if Trump HAD given way to Putin (which he clearly didn’t), how is a collapse of relations with Russia and a descent closer to war between nuclear-armed powers better than that? Should relations break down, it would be an extremely perilous development, as it would dramatically reduce our ability to reach a stable equilibrium between the US and Russia and avert a war. 
2022-03-21;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-60815547;climate change;Because the Biden administration antagonized Russia, and then responded to Russian aggression in Ukraine by calling for an end to purchases of Russian energy supplies, Russia-dependent European states are bridging the energy shortfall with more carbon-emitting fuel sources, thereby accelerating climate change. First of all, it is the fault of Biden’s most recent, most forceful push to integrate Russia neighbor Ukraine into the Western military-economic fabric which directly precipitated the Ukraine-Russia conflict in 2022. Russia has been clear in stating that it would not tolerate Ukraine’s absorption into the anti-Russian sphere of influence that is the EU and NATO. Despite this, every president since George W. Bush except Trump moved closer to admitting Ukraine into NATO. But it would appear from timing (quite convincingly) that Biden’s announcement of the US-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership on November 10, 2021, which calls to “deepen our strategic partnership”, is what pushed Russia to initiate its latest incursion into Ukraine. So the conflict which is causing European nations to satisfy their energy needs elsewhere can be directly tied to a move by Biden which Russia (not unreasonably) viewed as provocative. But then once the conflict touched off, it was Biden’s insistence that the world economically isolate Russia that caused European customers of Russian energy to turn to more carbon-emitting energy alternatives. In this way, it is fair to say that the acceleration in climate change which will ensue can be tied directly to Biden. 
2022-03-24;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60868795;authoritarianism;Now that is has been thoroughly proven that the Trump-Russia collusion accusation had no factual basis, Trump is moving to sue the Clinton for damaging his reputation. Not only was it known for years that the Democrats paid for the so-called “Steele dossier” on which the Trump-Russia collusion farce was based, but the FBI has since indicted the main source of the dossier’s contents,  Igor Danchenko, with lying to the FBI. To top it all off, it has also been proven that the Steele dossier, which was made up of fabricated claims, was then used as evidence for approving surveillance targeting Trump campaign figures. Given all of these facts, it is eminently reasonable and justifiable for Trump to sue the leader of the party that paid for the production of a false dossier that was then used to spy on his staffers. If the shoe was on the other foot—if the Republicans paid to create fake documents linking Clinton to Russia and then getting Clinton staffers targeted for surveillance based on those documents—Clinton would sue Trump, and rightly so.

How does this make any sense to any rational person? How can you engender understanding and restraint between your side and the other if you don’t even attempt dialog?This then begs the question: how committed is Biden to peace really? Either he isn’t, or he is so inept and reckless that he will shatter the peace by mistake.
2022-03-26;https://twitter.com/DowdEdward/status/1507763085225824257;COVID;Excess death numbers from the CDC for 2020 and 2021 show that excess deaths for the youngest age group (25-44 years of age) INCREASED by 47% from 2020 to 2021 despite the fact that vaccination rates were significantly higher in 2021 than in 2021 for that group (and all groups). Because the mRNA COVID “vaccine” was made available from older demographics to younger demographics, we know that vaccination rates among the 25-44 age group were low for most of 2020, as they were the last to become eligible. For about the first half of the year, the only Americans in this youngest age group to be offered vaccines were medical professionals and certain kinds of “essential workers”. In practice, the 25-44 age group had almost no vaccination levels until late spring/early summer 2020. By 2021, vaccination rates among the 25-44 group reached almost 3 in 4. So how is it possible that excess deaths in the youngest adults was GREATER in the second year of the pandemic, when almost 3 in 4 members of this group were vaccinated, than in the first year of the pandemic, when almost no one int his group was vaccinated? The most likely explanation is that this is because the mRNA “vaccine” isn’t very effective, with any benefit it may have granted this group outweighed by the fact that this group was the most likely to travel and socialize once they were vaccinated and felt invulnerable to COVID. The other strange phenomenon—strange, at least, if one believes that the mRNA jabs are as effective as their manufacturers and our public health officials profess—that the data shows is that excess deaths only went down by 13% from 2020 to 2021, from 592,000 to 512,000. If the mRNA “vaccine” is so effective, how come excess deaths only declined by 13%  from the year in which practically no Americans were vaccinated (2020) to the year where 60%+ Americans were vaccinated for the entire year (2021)? Again, the most likely explanation is that the COVID “vaccine” is just not that effective.
2022-03-27;https://twitter.com/JerryDunleavy/status/1508090991290601483;election;Biden’s approval ratings have slipped even further, to the point where only 40% of Americans approve of his job as president overall, and only 28% approve of his handling of Ukraine. How incompetent does a leader have to be to have less than 3 in 10 people approve of their handling a conflict with the potential to initiate nuclear war? It should be extremely difficult to have that little of Americans’ faith on an issue with such immense and terrifying potential consequences. All of this is against a backdrop in which the same people who voted for Biden swore that it was Trump who would have gotten us into a nuclear war. 
2022-03-27;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60895392;foreign policy;Even the liberal media is pointing out how dangerous Biden’s off-the-cuff call for the overthrow of Putin was. At the end of his NATO speech in Poland, Biden called for Putin, the leader of a nuclear-armed state currently in high tensions with the West, to be removed from power. This is dangerous for obvious reasons, those reasons being that the US is not only known for ruthlessly pursuing regime change since the start of the Cold War, but the US DID successfully overthrow the Yanukovych government in Ukraine in 2014 by backing the Maidan movement. So Putin has every reason to believe that when the US calls for his removal, it is serious. What other reaction could Putin possibly have than to take that as a serious threat?
2022-03-27;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60891803;foreign policy;Biden’s casual call for Putin’s overthrow (see above) was so dangerous that the US State Department had to immediately walk it back lest tensions between nuclear-armed Russia and the West escalate further.

On this, Macron is undoubtedly correct.

It would seem that only the Democrats are obsessed with blaming Russia for their domestic political defeat and giving Russia a black eye as payback. If the Democrats made such a convincing case that Russia tipped the scale in favor of one presidential candidate over another—which most Americans regardless of party would treat as a brazen and unacceptable affront if proven convincingly—then why is it that so few Americans are interested in a war with Russia? Yes, it is true that many Republicans are so rapidly partisan that they would not express any concern if it were the case that Russia had helped Trump win, a claim for which there is no evidence. But a good number of Republicans would condemn this (rightly), and practically all Democrats and independents would as well. So the fact that Americans don’t want the war the Democrats are pushing suggests that Americans don’t buy the narrative that Russia decided the election for Trump. And why should they? As stated earlier, the Trump-Russia collusion story is dead, exposed as a fake by the very indictment for perjury of the individual who compiled the document that launched the investigation into said supposed collusion. To Biden’s credit, he has publicly stated that he will firmly resist calls to enter the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But to his criticism, Biden has shot off his mouth with dangerously provocative remarks in the last couple of weeks. So conflict is very much still possible. 
2022-03-28;https://www.axios.com/judge-trump-eastman-documents-jan-6-committee-8fe17985-75eb-4c28-a51e-b74760def3ec.html;authoritarianism;A pro-Democrat judge leverages his position (and associated credibility) to make sweeping, unproven, (in a court of law) condemnatory claims that Trump attempted a “coup” on January 6, 2021. The judge, David Carter, ordered that a lawyer acting in Trump’s interests surrender documents associated with the Capitol Riot. This in itself is not objectionable, as the judge was carrying out the legal judgment in regards to the case before him. However, Carter then used the case to opine on the motive and nature of the actions of Trump in regards to the events of January 6, 2021. This is an overstep, indeed an abuse, of his judicial authority. Judges have no place making criminal accusations, or pronouncing guilt, from the bench. Not only that, but the pronouncements Carter made are self-contradictory and have no rational basis. He stated that Trump instigated “a coup in search of a legal theory”. This is nonsensical. Coups require no legal theory—they are by their very nature, illegal. A coup wields pure force to end the legal regime of one government and impose a new one. Furthermore, if a party pursues a legal theory, and seeks to secure a change in election outcome through the courts, then this is by definition not a coup. If the law allows for an election challenge, then it cannot be considered illegal to pursue such a challenge. Hence, by stating that Trump’s coup sought a legal justification is to smear a legitimate recourse as criminal and treasonous, a dangerous and undemocratic practice. Carter in fact criticizes the pursuit of legal theories in general, as though he is unaware as a judge that every argument in court which succeeds and sets a precedent begins as a legal theory. The attempted acceptance of legal theories is the bedrock of our legal system, allowing it to evolve to fit the changing mores and needs of our society. Additionally, Carter accuses Trump of attempting to “overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history”. But if we are to take Carter’s own line of argumentation, wasn’t the Democrats’ Supreme Court challenge of Bush’s victory over Gore the exact same thing? No party gets to have it both ways: either seeking a change in election results through the courts is acceptable regardless of which party is the author (the legally-consistent and democratic perspective), or it is unacceptable regardless of party. Worse, not only does a supposedly impartial judge bias his views in favor of the Democrats, but he lies in the process. He claims that Capitol Riot “led to the deaths of several law enforcement officers” but this is false. There is no evidence, neither medical reports nor video evidence nor reliable witness testimony nor conviction in a court of law, to suggest that any rioters killed any law enforcement personnel. At most, with an immense stretch in semantics, one could claim that the “attacks” on the Capitol building “led to” the death of Officer Sicknick in the sense that the event directly preceded his death by natural means. The working theory behind is death is that, since Sicknick survived the event and went home, only to die days later not by apparent suicide, that the stress of the event exacerbated some underlying health condition which ultimately killed him. Considering Carter’s remarks in this light, it becomes inescapably clear that he sought to use his position to bias future legal proceedings surrounding the Capitol Riot against Trump, an extremely perilous precedent to set in our legal system.

2022-03-31;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60936468;foreign policy;Biden releases the most petroleum ever from the US’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the purely partisan aim of lowering gas prices which he is responsible for increasing and cushioning the Democrats’ likely election defeats in the 2022 midterms. This supply is intended to equip the US military to operate in the event of an extremely dire threat to the nation in which oil is not readily available. So by drawing down the supply, he is making the nation less secure and insulated from oil embargoes, solely to help his party in an election. This is simply unacceptable: no party should be able to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower civilian gas prices, or for any other partisan purpose. But for the Democrats, there is no lever of power they won’t use to serve their own ends. Ironically, considering they accuse the Republicans of this, the Democrats put party above country, yet another case of psychological projection.

This episode is remarkable only for how quickly the fabrication fell apart. 
2022-04-04;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eJ5TIT6zvk;COVID;Pfizer mRNA “vaccine” documents ordered released by the courts show that Pfizer knew from the time that it applied for EUA approval that (1) natural immunity is superior to vaccine immunity, (2) vaccine side effects including myocarditis are more common and more severe in younger individuals, and (3) the company is unsure of the long-term effects the mRNA vaccine will have on fertility and the possibility of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). These facts are ones that COVID “vaccine” skeptics have been pointing to for a long time and yet were dismissed by the very public health officials who had access to this information at the time. None of this is to say that no one should take the vaccine. But it is to say that the concerns that skeptics raised were wrongly dismissed as untrue or invalid. In fact, the fact most forcefully denied by the public health establishment, that the vaccines carry a notable risk of myocarditis for young children (especially males), is the one that the case against vaccinating this group rested upon. The risk of young children dying of COVID is very small, but public health officials pushed vaccination on this group on the now-disproven premise that the vaccine posed no real side effect risk so it was worth it to mitigate the tiny risk of COVID. Now we know irrefutably, from Pfizer’s own reports, that the case for vaccinating children is far from convincing. It should also be noted that the fact that Pfizer explicitly noted that it does not know the long-term effects its mRNA treatment will have on fertility and ADE means they are concerned about precisely these outcomes. Why would the company call out its uncertainty on these areas SPECIFICALLY if it did not have any more concern about them than any other long-term outcomes? Skeptics of the mRNA COVID treatments should watch for signs of exactly these outcomes as time goes on. In fact, some data already suggests that we may see these issues crop up. In regard to fertility, studies already show that the mRNA treatment impacts menstrual cycles. And new data from the CDC on excess deaths, showing more excess deaths for the youngest identified group INCREASED from 2020 to 2021, might be a result of ADE (though there is not enough evidence as yet to say). Public health officials are now clearly proven to be wrong to deny these concerns. They have also been proven wrong in claiming that the vaccinated could not transmit COVID and had almost no chance of catching COVID. Clearly, vaccine skeptics have had a strong track record. So what other concerns of theirs will be proven right in the long run? What other public health officials’ claims will we find out were not only wrong but were known by those officials to be wrong at the time they were made?

It’s amusing, and predictable, how people addicted to virtue signaling will vocally glom onto a cause as long as it doesn’t impact them directly, but then instantly contradict the core premise of that cause as soon as they experience direct negative consequences of the furtherance of that cause. This dynamic is the very essence of being a scared, rank-and-file, sheeplike Democrat supporter: mindlessly parrot the talking points that the radical fringe of their party advocates and then complain about the consequences. Residents of neighborhoods like these have no one to blame but themselves for the negative impact their activism has yielded.

In other words, if the experimental never-before-used-in-humans vaccine that the state pressured teachers to take doesn’t work, then those teachers enjoy state support. But if teachers who exercised their own free choice not to take this experimental gene treatment—for religious, medical, or a number of any other valid reasons—contract COVID, the state deems them unworthy of support. What business does a government have to preferentially treat, with significant employment benefits, some employees and not others? The state does not grant non-smokers with more sick days than smokers. The state does not grant healthy individuals with more sick days than the overweight. This is as it should be, and consistent with the Hippocratic oath on which the Western Enlightenment-Rationalist practice of medicine is founded. Through this policy, the state of Illinois is working to erode this foundational principle to empower it to coerce citizens into its preferred mode of behavior, something states should not be in the habit of doing. 
2022-04-05;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1511335709013168135;authoritarianism;Literally the same liberal elites who chided that social networks do not have to enshrine free speech are wailing that Elon Musk’s elevation to the board of Twitter will erode free speech in our national discourse. The hypocrites who maintain these views, with the implication being that censoring their opponents (the politically center-right and rightward) have views too dangerous to be expressed while they insist on the right to express as radical (left-wing) views as they wish, are spineless authoritarians who stand for nothing save their own right to control others. They deserve no credence in any open discourse because they manifestly do not believe in open discourse. The left believes that it gets to say anything while the right should not be allowed to dissent. By contrast, while the right is seeking to remove mature content from the reach of children, they have made NO moves to censor or control what adults may choose to consume or express. This plainly authoritarian impulse thriving on the left is what makes them the far greater fascist threat than the right in this current political environment (the US, and the West more broadly, in the 2020s). Anyone who claims otherwise has no evidentiary leg to stand on. 
2022-04-08;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-60999431;authoritarianism;After months of the FBI, the Democrats, their supporters insisting that Republican supporters were guilty of pursuing a plot to kidnap Democrat governor Gretchen Whitmer—and that this was a portent of more radical right-wing plots to come, the FBI was unable to convict even a single “plotter” of any crime in connection with the kidnapping plot. Not only that, but this colossal prosecutorial failure comes after the FBI concocted and supplied the plot as part of an entrapment scheme, and then lured right-wing dupes to take the fall. Considering that the FBI couldn’t convict the accused despite architecting a sting specifically to do so could not more firmly establish the accused’s innocence. This, along with the Capitol Riots and Freedom Convoy affinity protests, is part of a Democrat narrative to paint all but the most self-effacing and moderate Republicans as a domestic extremist threat, only to permit Antifa to operate unopposed and condone the staggering loss of life and property in the George Floyd riots. The Democrats have to invent or inflate right-wing violent plots while left-wing violence continues unabated. Who are the real fascists, when one party (the Democrats) fabricates violence by the other party’s (the Republicans’) supporters while allowing its own supporters to act as violent street enforcers of its political agenda?
2022-04-11;https://twitter.com/Keggs719/status/1513700943556222980;COVID;The fearmongering media allies of the Democrats are trying to drum up fear of a new COVID wave even though, if such a wave is occurring, there is no wave of hospitalizations and deaths. What makes COVID bad is that it hospitalizes and kills people. It is less damaging the degree to which it hospitalizes and kills less people. This is the reason why we are not quarantining people over the common cold: as common as it is, it very rarely kills anyone. The current state of the pandemic, in which most nations have relaxed their controls, was mostly possibly because of later dominants variants strains of SARS-CoV-2 that were less lethal, such as Omicron. So if COVID is still not hospitalizing and killing very many people, it doesn’t matter that much how prevalent it is. If COVID diluted in lethality to the point where it was just another cold, would—should—anyone be worried? In light of this thought experiment, we shouldn’t worry about COVID unless it starts killing in large numbers again. So why is the Washington Post so concerned? Probably because it gives an excuse to its Democrat friends to hold onto emergency executive powers. Only one political party is using the pandemic to impose onerous emergency measures on Americans.

This is the surest sign yet that Americans are ready to move on, and not continue crippling the economy for negligible reduction in deaths. What business do Democrats, elected representatives who serve the people, have in continuing COVID public health measures when Americans don’t view it as a problem? Restricting freedoms to address a problem that citizens are not concerned with is the hallmark of tyranny. 
2022-04-12;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-61089381;foreign policy;In another stupid and reckless comment lashing out at Putin and risking escalation with Russia, Biden baselessly claimed that Putin is carrying out “genocide” in Ukraine. Biden seems not to have learned in school what “genocide” means, which is the systematic and complete elimination of an ethnic or religious group. What about Russia’s behavior indicates that they are SERIOUSLY undertaking the complete elimination of the Ukrainian people? If they were, why aren’t they bombing entire cities into rubble? Why are Russian soldiers be managing occupied cities, such as by policing street demonstrations, instead of rounding up all their residents and putting them to death? Russians are destroying buildings and killing civilians, but these are the exception rather than the rule. This is not in ANY way to excuse what Russia is doing, but their actions can be worthy of condemnation and still not rise to the level of genocide. What does Biden get out of accusing Putin of genocide? All it does is isolate Putin more, and possibly threaten him with a war crimes trial, which just backs him into a corner and makes it more likely he will deploy nuclear weapons. How careless can Biden be to throw around groundless accusations that only push Russia into a more precarious position in regards to the West? 
2022-04-12;https://web.archive.org/web/20140519194937/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism, https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Marxism_conspiracy_theory;authoritarianism;When comparing the Wikipedia entry for “Cultural Marxism” from 2014 with the “Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory” entry which the topic redirects to in 2022, the former is treated rationally on a factual basis while the other is overtly designated, dismissively, as an antisemitic conspiracy theory. Most “conspiracy theories” are either plainly false or shown to be false using evidence. A very minuscule subset of conspiracy theories are proven true. But how it is possible for something to be regarded as true and then later labeled as a “false” conspiracy theory when none of the facts that support its truthfulness were disproven? It would one thing if facts central to substantiating the factual existence of a phenomenon were later found to be untrue—that indeed would make a theory false which was previously regarded as true. But when no facts come to light disproving a theory, and no facts supporting it have been disproven, how can a theory suddenly be false? Moreover, what is antisemitic about criticizing a philosophy which anyone of any religious (or atheistic) background may hold? The opponents of the “Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory” are making an antisemitic association that the theory’s supporters are not. Who is the real antisemite: the person who criticizes an areligious philosophy, or the person who says criticizing that philosophy is hateful to Jewish people when no one who criticized the philosophy in good faith voiced any ill will toward Jewish people? Most importantly, when reading the 2014 edition of the article, Cultural Marxism is defined by exactly the real-world practices that those who argue that Cultural Marxism existence point to. What the believers in Cultural Marxism’s existence say is evidence of Cultural Marxism actually exists. The 2014 version states that cultural Marxism “cultural phenomena intrinsic to Western society, for instance… gender roles, race, and other forms of cultural identity are historically recent developments that help justify and maintain hierarchy”. Is this not what the progressive left “antiracists” and LGBT movement supporters, the people that proponents of Cultural Marxism’s existence point to to prove its existence, explicitly SAY they believe? How can the progressive left say it believes in something, their opponents point to it and give it a name, and the progressive left deny that the named phenomenon exists? This is the very definition of gaslighting, and Wikipedia clearly condones it when it serves the left. 
2022-04-12;https://twitter.com/libbyemmons/status/1513955166407507968;identity;The lead suspect, who is African-American, in a mass shooting on New York’s MTA public transit system is not being regarded as an identity extremist terrorist, and was apprehended with few (if any) injuries by ordinary police officers, a stark refutation of the left’s insistence that black people are routinely and casually murdered by police officers. The left claims that not only are black people constantly brutalized by police, but that this is done even when the target of this brutality is unarmed and suspected of very minor crimes. Despite this stubbornly held belief, NYPD officers apprehended the suspect in a mass shooting—meaning they had every reason to believe he was armed and willing to attack law enforcement—without deadly force so that he will be able to stand trial. The fact that the suspect is black coincides with the selective and skewed media coverage that this brazen attack is receiving. And though it certainly can’t be proven, as it is conjecture, it seems reasonable to suspect that, had the attacker been white, his deeds would have received massive mainstream media coverage and he would have been immediately accused, by both the criminal court and the court of public opinion, of being a white supremacist terrorist (regardless of whether counter-terrorist personnel or resources were actually deployed to apprehend him). In this instance the accused used social media to advocate “black nationalist”—truly, this is more aptly put as “black supremacist”—views. When white supremacists commit violence, they are regarded as “identity extremist” terrorist, which is reasonable. And yet when a black supremacist commits violence, their hatefulness and racial supremacy is nowhere to be found in media’s characterization of the attack. It is truly galling that the left claims that there is an anti-black bias in policing and law enforcement, given this fact, and given the fact that white people are brutalized by police in higher numbers than black people. The left loves advancing their point of view using anecdotes, so if that’s how they choose to debate, they will have to contend with this extremely illustrative anecdote.

The left loves to deride Republican-controlled states as the lowest-performing education systems in the nation. And yet a very liberal publican conceded that California has the lowest reading scores in America. If the Democrats had such effective education policies, why wouldn’t the most heavily Democrat-controlled state (i.e. needing to make the fewest compromises to their policies with Republicans) have the highest literacy rates? California essentially has no excuses for performing this abysmally. The data reported here, citing that 23% of Californians over age 15 can’t read at a high school level, makes for a sound argument against Democrats being allowed to set education policy. 
2022-04-12;https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/17-LA-gangs-have-sent-out-crews-to-follow-and-rob-17076319.php;law enforcement;Coinciding with the freer hand they are receiving from the “defund the police”-driven curtailing of police activity, more than a dozen gangs in LA are actively organizing their operations to rob the wealthy, the very people most statistically likely to advocate for defunding the police. How is it that this can surprise anyone? When a political movement pressures prosecutors to criminally charge every police officer who is pushed to use lethal force against a black suspect, the result will be police avoiding scenarios where such force may be required. Police shying away from encounters which may turn violent, in turn, will result in criminals (especially gangs) becoming more brazen. Combine that with the severe economic damage inflicted by Democrats’ heavy-handed COVID public health policies and these more audacious criminals will naturally target the wealthy. Ergo, anyone who advocates defunding the police is not allowed to complain when they are the victim of violent crime. Polling from the 2020 presidential election and reviews of FEC campaign donation filings unambiguously illustrate that the wealthier someone is, the more likely they are to support the Democrats, especially leftist ones. So it is not a stretch to guess that the people who will be the most common victims of these criminal enterprises are the very people who most vocally supported defunding the police. They have no one to blame for their possible fates but themselves.

France generally, and Macron specifically, is not conservative by any stretch. So his condemnation of Biden’s careless and casual accusation carries weight.

How can anyone seriously argue that Trump was more reckless than Biden at this point?

This is the logical endpoint for Woke ideology and its assertion that racism only targets black people and not white people: they maintain that white supremacy exists and motivates terrorists (which is undoubtedly true), but that black supremacy does not exist and therefore can never be the reason behind an attack (an attack which should not be regarded by the FBI as terrorism). In the eyes of the left, it is not acceptable for extremists to try to kill all black people (indeed, we can ALL agree that this ISN’T acceptable), but it IS acceptable to try to kill all white people. As adherents of a radical ideology that preaches that racism is evil and all white people are racist, the Woke cannot possibly believe other than that killing all white people is acceptable. How is Wokeism not clearly seen for the extremist ideology that it is? How is it that people can give violence like that in New York this week a pass (at least insofar as labeling it as identity extremist terrorism)?

Apologists for Biden have been attributing inflation to pandemic-related disruptions to the supply chain, in an effort to exculpate Biden from blame for inflation. But these apologists have now been clearly proven wrong, by Biden’s own advisors. It turns out that printing trillions of dollars has a greater impact on inflation than delays in overseas production and shipping, something that anyone who took a high school economics course should be able to tell you, and yet which diehard Democrat supporters stubbornly denied.

How much weaker can Biden come across if our own Congress has reason to believe Taiwan will be the next domino to fall? It would be one thing if China or some unaligned entity suggested or conjectured that Taiwan would be the next target of invasion. It’s quite another for the US Congress, which is party to intelligence briefings, to voice concern over Taiwan. If Congress—and a bipartisan group at that—thinks Taiwan is in danger, there is reason to take its assessment seriously. An uneasy equilibrium has persisted between Taiwan and China for half a century, and yet it was under Biden’s watch that the danger to Taiwan escalated to truly alarming degrees. What does this say about his leadership? That his leadership weak—in fact, that we acknowledge that his leadership is weak.

More than any of that, it is manipulative and unethical to justify a public health control to citizens as a way of reducing spread when it was really intended to coerce them into taking an experimental gene therapy. Essentially, the emotional and psychological anguish of the lockdown is intended, according to Fauci, to be so excruciating that citizens break down and take an experimental drug whose manufacturers tried to hide regulatory data from them for 80 years. Fauci has furnished yet more proof that he never deserved the public trust, abusing his power as the nation’s top public health policymaker to coerce Americans into taking medical treatments they would not have otherwise taken.

Prior infection and mRNA vaccination both confer immunity to COVID. So if the vaccine is truly effective, how is it possible that the vaccine’s effectiveness is so low when augmented by antibodies from natural infection? Shouldn’t those with natural and vaccine-provided immunity (referred to as “hybrid” immunity) be the best protected? How, then, did the vaccine only prevent hospitalization less than half the time against Delta, and just over a third of the time against Omicron? As explained below [see 2022-04-21, Axios], the nature of how the mRNA shot leads to antibody production is extremely taxing on the immune system (compared to the traditional inactivated virus vaccines), leaving it vulnerable to infection in the weeks after injection. And because the virus is mutating, antibodies for the wild type only become more and more distant from the viral genetic sequence that someone can be exposed to. What kind of vaccine gets LESS effective against reinfection against a virus you’ve been infected with once? That’s not true of any other vaccine, even the flu vaccine. How is it anyone has any faith in this vaccine anymore, let alone continue to inject themselves with boosters?

This may be so, but how does that excuse him from taking 12 seconds to figure out that the plan had changed and that there was nothing for him to do but exit the stage? How can someone who wield so much power have such a dull mental edge? If Trump did that, the Democrats would be demanding the invocation of the 25th Amendment the next day.

2022-04-15;https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-adopts-poison-pill-fight-musk-2022-04-15/;authoritarianism;In order to keep Musk from purchasing Twitter, which he has vowed to realign with preserving free speech, at a rate above what its shares are currently worth, Twitter has adopted a so-called “poison pill” plan to discount share prices to existing shareholders. The “shareholder rights” plan stipulates that if any single entity attempts to purchase 15% of Twitter’s shares or more, other shareholders will be offered the chance to buy shares at a price below their current value, which would reduce the controlling stake of this entity. Declining a cash deal offering more than the current share price times the total shares in circulation will already have the effect of dropping share prices. But to then implement a mechanism which will drop the price to allow shares to be concentrated out of Musk’s hands will drop the share value even further. Why would Twitter, which has historically struggled to turn a profit and sorely lags in technical innovation, turn down a better deal than they have any right to expect, and than they have ever been offered previously? It’s not as though it is uncommon for individual billionaires to solely own and/or control traditional and social media companies, despite claims by the deal’s opponents to the contrary. The whole reason behind Musk’s offer is to restore Twitter’s professed value of free speech, and he has voiced no other intentions to significantly depart from the company’s current business philosophy. The fact that Twitter is scrambling to avoid the best deal they have ever been offered (and probably ever will be) shows just how desperate its current owners are to maintain their ability to NOT respect free speech… i.e. to censor. Because if Twitter DID already respect free speech, what would be the harm in taking more money than they have any right to expect, and keep operating as usual? The fact that they aren’t doing this proves that they use Twitter to control the narrative of online discourse, and they know it. Moreover, critics condemnation of “oligarchs” controlling the flow of information rings hollow when these same critics (such as Robert Reich) don’t bat an eye when Bezos purchased the Washington Post, or when Bradley bought Atlantic Media. These critics don’t actually care if the wealthy control the media—they just can’t stand it when billionaires (or anyone, really) that don’t agree with their authoritarian worldview own media companies. The shameless, hypocritical hand-wringing is so illustrative of how the pro-left elites believe the world should be run, and that way is to suppress all dissent, burning any amount of money to do so. The board of Twitter is willing to lose billions of dollars that their company has no prayer of earning through its pathetic attempts at a business model, all to maintain the ability to censor even the faintest murmur of dissent against their political orthodoxy. Anyone who values freedom of speech, and indeed freedom of thought, can never forget this.

If this assessment turns out to be accurate, By definition, this means that inflation is not the transitory problem that Democrat apologists insist that it is. The fact that Democrats at the federal government level can’t get inflation under control even with the lowest COVID numbers since the pandemic began, and the associated lifting of all operating restrictions on businesses, just shows the staggering degree of their incompetence.

It goes without saying that, of course, Lorenz did not request a comment from the owner of the Libs of TikTok Twitter account before revealing the real-life identity and home address of the account’s owner, the very thing Lorenz cried was journalistically unethical. For the left, their opponents deserve no ethical treatment, and instead deserve to be exposed for anyone to threaten merely for revealing unflattering truths about what the left believes. 
2022-04-21;https://www.axios.com/us-covid-cases-on-the-rise-in-mid-atlantic-pacific-northwest-424b7d8a-4515-412a-8f24-3e58e6746e26.html;COVID;All of the states with the highest rates of mRNA vaccination are now experiencing the fastest rise in COVID cases, and simultaneously all the states with the lowest vaccination rates are seeing a DECREASE in COVID cases. New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Washington, DC are all leading the way in COVID case increases, with California, Oregon, and Washington state close behind. Meanwhile Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and the Carolinas are seeing decreases in cases. Texas and Florida are experiencing case increases as well, but at a slower rate than New England and the Pacific Northwest. If the mRNA “vaccine” is so effective, this shouldn’t be possible. If, indeed, another COVID wave is on its way in the US (as the previous two summers would suggest is likely), then an effective vaccine should lead to the least-vaccinated states seeing the fastest rise in cases, and the most-vaccinated states seeing slower increases. Yet the opposite is occurring. At this point, how can anyone stand by the vaccine and continue to insist on its effectiveness, to say nothing of employee and private business patron vaccine requirements? So why is this happening? There are so many factors that it’s hard to say. One likely contributing factor is the fact that, with every injection of the mRNA sequence, the injectee’s body perceives itself as being under attack, and an immune response is triggered. But this is not the same kind of mild immune response that results from taking a traditional inactivated virus vaccine, where incapacitated viral particles are injected and the immune system attacks the foreign bodies without resistance. When the mRNA instructions enter your body, cells pick them up and execute them. Every cell exposed to the mRNA sequence is another producer of spike proteins that the immune system must respond to. But cells don’t just stay still—as a regular prat of human cellular metabolism, cells divide to produce exact copies. If these copies have the mRNA sequence, they produce spike proteins, too. So unlike traditional inactivated virus vaccines where a static number of viral particles are introduced and then destroyed (to produce antibodies), with every cell division, more spike protein producers pop into existence, exponentially increasing spike protein presence. And recall that studies show the spike proteins to be cytotoxic. Indeed, this behavior can be inferred from the fact that studies show that immune responses is suppressed in the weeks following an mRNA “vaccine” injection, because the immune system is working hard to fight an exponentially increasing quantity of cytotoxic spike proteins. So how can this have any other effect than to leave the vaccinated MORE vulnerable to a real COVID infection, especially as the virus only continues to mutate away from the genetic sequence which the mRNA “vaccines” encode?

Again, the judge wasn’t saying that mask mandates are good or bad. The judge merely ruled that the CDC does not have the power under current law to make impose that policy on the entire nation, which is an intuitive and reasonable ruling. Unelected bureaucrats should not be able to dictate what Americans must do to travel. Such power should only be vested in an elected official, so that decisions of such consequence can be reviewed by voters at the ballot box. But Democrats don’t believe the democratic process should be able to obstruct their policy aims. How is this attitude anything other than authoritarian?

It is indisputable that the lockdown drove record rates of drug abuse. Studies also show that the lockdowns only reduced COVID deaths by 0.5% in the US. For that trade-off, the US lost a large chunk of its workforce. When there are fewer workers, the output of the goods and services they produce goes down and/or the cost f those goods and services increases. This is simple economics. QED, the ineffective lockdown policies of the Democrats have been proven to cause the current staggering inflation in yet another way. It should be evident by this point to anyone who reviews the real data that this inflation was avoidable, and that signature Democrat pandemic policies are why we failed to avoid it. 
2022-04-25;https://www.reuters.com/technology/human-rights-groups-raise-hate-speech-concerns-after-musks-takeover-twitter-2022-04-25/;authoritarianism;The ACLU, which historically staunchly defended the values of free speech—even if doing so meant protecting hateful speech—is now standing against Musk’s purchase of Twitter on the grounds that it will increase the amount of hateful speech on the platform. In the past, the ACLU has defended literal Nazis in their right to mount demonstrations of their hateful ideology purely because that group has the same First Amendment rights as any other in America. The ACLU’s defense of free speech, in this and similar cases, rested on the principle that a threat to any American’s rights is a threat to all Americans’ rights. If the government successfully censors the speech of one group, no matter how abhorrent the group’s views may be, it sets the legal precedent for the censorship of any other group. Once that door is open, it cannot be closed. Now, however, the ACLU has forfeit all of its principles, prostituted every ounce of its integrity, to leave free speech for dead in order to don the politically fashionable (in the left circles it travels in) garb of countering “hate speech”. The organization is condemning Musk for expressing the desire to restore the value that the ACLU itself long claimed to champion purely to curry favor with its left-wing donors. The ACLU is attempting to veil its nakedly partisan objectives behind the pretext that it is against billionaires controlling speech. When it comes to Facebook, though, the ACLU takes the opposite view from its view of Musk’s Twitter: Facebook is flagging TOO MUCH content as hate speech out of a desire to censor views it dislikes. Under this double-standard, if the ACLU doesn’t like certain content, you can never “moderate” (i.e. censor) it enough, but if the ACLU does like certain content, it is unacceptable that it gets moderated. The sad case of the ACLU’s descent into a partisan servant of the Democrats is proof that, if the left gains control of any body or institution, it will cease to have any ideological consistency or principles. Rather, it will use anything at its disposal to advance its agenda.

Just as anyone with even the most rudimentary grasp of game theory could have predicted, once the police responded to the disincentive to use force against criminal perpetrators (for fear of losing their job and facing criminal charges), crime increased. The residents of Lincoln Park led the way in the BLM and “Defund the Police” movements that signaled to cops that they are better off sitting on their hands and collecting a paycheck than attempting to stop violent crime and risking their livelihood and freedom when activists condemn them. So now those same people who pushed the police away are now taking their security into their own hands. Who will be easier to hold accountable for racial profiling or excessive force, some private security contractor or a taxpayer-funded and (elected) mayor-controlled law enforcement body? Which do you think is going to be more careful to respect the rights of minorities, a company that answers only to its clients (the neighborhood), or a police force that the entire city can vote on? How does replacing police with private security make life better for non-white individuals? 
2022-04-25;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61218611;law enforcement;The number of police officers killed while on duty has risen by 59% from 2020 to 2021, according to the FBI. Murders in general have increased by anywhere from 29% to 44% since 2019. This is no doubt due the left social justice movements deincentivizing police from doing their job when their job demands for them to use force to stop criminal violence. As explained numerous times here, when any cop who uses a weapon is immediately targeted by activists and hauled before a prosecutor, cops will use their weapons less often—perversely, cops are not reprimanded when allowing crime to go unchecked, but only when they attempt to stop it. To provide a fair reading of events, crime has also likely resulted from the economic devastation wrought by the pandemic. But here, too, the blames rests with the political left: it was Democrats who insisted on keeping the economy shut down for over a year for lockdowns which only decreased COVID deaths by 0.5%. Rising crime is one thing, but targeting the police specifically is quite another. The left is quick to decry any negative characterization of an identity group (regardless of whether or not what was expressed was factually and empirically hateful by the definition of hate crime laws) because it supposedly increases violence against that group. There is nothing wrong with this logic per se, but yet they don’t apply it to opposing groups. The left condemns vitriolic speech against non-white people, but not against white people or police, even when it correlates with increases in violence against these groups. In fact, the left actively expresses vicious speech targeting white people and police. This is yet another realm in which the left insists that they get to write the rules that their opponents must follow, while exempting themselves.

It turns out most leftists have no principles when it inconveniences them or goes against their financial interests. If Musk’s takeover of the Twitter and attendant vow to restore free speech on the platform was the grave threat to peoples’ safety that the board claimed, why is the board rolling over so easily? If, as they claimed, this purchase threatened to bring a deluge of “hate speech” to Twitter, wouldn’t they be fighting harder to keep Musk away? Shouldn’t morality be more important than money? The fact that the Twitter board is choosing money over morals shows just how sincere (i.e. completely insincere) their line of argument was. 
2022-04-26;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/04/26/60-of-americans-have-now-had-covid-with-omicron-fueling-surge-this-winter-cdc-says/;COVID;CDC data shows that 60% of Americans, including 75% of American children under 12, have had COVID, showing how utterly ineffective the vaccine is and how overwhelmingly safe children are from dangerous COVID outcomes (given the simultaneously minuscule COVID death numbers for children in this age group). If the mRNA “vaccines” are so effective, how is it that 60% of Americans are fully vaccinated (even more if counting even one dose) and yet 60% of Americans have had COVID? Even if every unvaccinated person had COVID (which is not the case), that would mean that 1/3 of fully vaccinated Americans caught COVID anyway. And if only half of unvaccinated Americans caught COVID (which would still be an incredibly high proportion), that would mean that 2/3 of fully vaccinated Americans caught COVID. The true proportions are probably somewhere in the middle, but that means that at best taking the “vaccine” is barely more effective than not taking it. This data also means that there is basically no case for vaccinating children against COVID. As of April 20, 2022, CDC data indicates that 386 Americans age 0 to 4 years and 781 Americans aged 5 to 18 years died from COVID, for a total of 1167 children. The new CDC data indicates that 75% of children under 12 years old contracted COVID, so even if we compare that against all 1167 child deaths, which would be too many considering that it includes deaths of children 12 and older, this would mean that COVID poses almost no threat to children. There are 48 million children age 0 to 11 in the US. At an infection rate of 75%, that means that 36 million children have been infected with COVID. So if out of those 36 million children, only 1167 died (which, again, is an over-count), how can any rational person call COVID a serious threat to children meriting vaccination with experimental vaccines which (as shown above) aren’t even that effective on adults? That is a COVID death rate of 0.0032%! Considering that most (75% of) children got COVID anyway, why risk the side effects of the vaccine to avert the extremely unlikely chance of a child dying of COVID? Vaccine apologists argue that COVID has side-effects, but even so, if most children have had COVID already, why risk more side effects by vaccinating them when it is extremely unlikely they will die? With every new data release, the vaccine is shown to be less and less effective, posing downsides for very little upside.

How would Russia interpret this in any other way than an act of US aggression? Why does the US think that Russia will not retaliate in some way, increasing the chances of open war between the US and Russia? It’s one thing to secretly supply Ukraine with US intelligence, which is dangerous enough since it has the potential to be discovered. It’s another thing to openly state that such intelligence is being shared. At every turn, the US government is stepping up its provocation of Russia, as if they’re daring Russia to attack the US. By the sheer recklessness of these actions, it is clear that those at the highest levels of our government have no grasp of the threat of global nuclear annihilation that they are flirting with. 
2022-04-27;https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2022/04/27/republican-senators-gained-almost-160000-twitter-followers-after-elon-musks-deal;authoritarianism;According to analysis by The Economist, after Musk announced the conclusion of the deal to purchase Twitter, Republican senators’ accounts gained an average of 3400 followers while Democrats senators’ accounts lost an average of 2700 followers. What is behind this? The decrease in Democrats’ followers could be a result of left-wingers fleeing Twitter to escape exposure to views they don’t like once Twitter allows those views to be expressed. But then why would Republicans gain followers? It could be that a flood of Republican supporters suddenly joined Twitter in anticipation of being able to express their views freely on the platform, but this seems unlikely, as Musk has not taken over and guaranteed free speech yet. If the new free speech policy is not yet in place, why would Republican supporters flock to Twitter? Moreover, all the Republican supporters who are already one Twitter would already be following all the Republican accounts they intended to follow. You can’t follow someone twice. So again, what’s happening? The most likely explanation is that Twitter is trying to appear less guilty of what Musk charged it with, namely suppressing speech, by unbanning Republican supporters’ accounts. This way, when Musk sets foot in the door, Twitter won’t look as bad as he claimed and the Twitter staff can insist that his criticism was unfounded. This dynamic would prove that there is an anti-right bias on Twitter. At the very least, such a bias is perceived to be true, or else there wouldn’t be a surge in followers for Republican accounts. By the left’s own logic, if one perceives a bias against oneself, then a bias does in fact exist. So if applied uniformly, this would mean that because the right sees Twitter as biased against them, it in fact is. But this is not mere conjecture: Twitter’s suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story in the New York Post is proof enough.

How is this handling of the economy better than Trump’s? The only time that GDP decreased during Trump’s presidency was during the Q1 and Q2 of 2020. During Q3, growth rebounded incredibly fast and then began a robust recovery. This recovery continued for the first year of Biden’s presidency, but has now stalled. When Trump took office and saw an immediate economic bump, it was discounted as being actually the work of Obama pushing the economy on a positive trajectory. Of course, the left is not applying the same logic to Biden’s first year, attributing it in reality to the ripples from Trump’s economic policy. Regardless, how is it that, despite the US reaching a 60% vaccination rate with a supposedly effective vaccine and the resumption of normal operation by most businesses, Biden is still seeing economic contraction? Most likely this is because of the abnormally sharp rise in inflation… which of course is in turn Biden’s fault. Where is everyone who said that Biden had a plan and that Trump’s strong economy was a fluke? What’s their excuse for Biden failing on the most significant promise he made?
2022-04-28;https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1519699408027328517;identity;According to the pro-Democrat double-standard at work in American culture, Democrats are allowed to use racial slurs against conservatives, but nothing—not even free speech—justifies anyone else using hateful slurs. Racial and hate slurs are, of course, despicable. However, they are not more or less despicable when one political party uses them. Hateful speech is hateful regardless of who utters it, and against whom it was uttered. Either free speech applies as a defense for anyone who engages in hate speech, or free speech is invalid as a defense for anyone engaging in hate speech, period. But the Democrats are only too ready to condemn their opponents’ hate speech and dismiss the principle of free speech as a justification, but when they use hate speech, they cower behind the free speech they deny to others. This is the hallmark of capricious tyrants: rules are for others, not for themselves. Thus it is that a sitting congressional Democrat can call Clarence Thomas an “Uncle Tom” and get away with it, and other Democrats can cover for him when confronted by a Republican. The Democrats are so unwilling to face an even-handed application of their own rules that when Jeffries (a Democrat) dismissed Paoletta’s (a Republican) charge of racism, he flatly and brazenly denied Paolette the opportunity to provide another example. How can Democrats claim to fight racism when they are afraid to face the racism of their own members? Shouldn’t the party that supposedly values racial justice want to hear every allegation of racism so that, if substantiated, it can be addressed and healed? This is all the proof anyone needs (though it abounds) that the Democrats never cared about racial justice, and that it’s all a political prop that their supporters are too brainwashed to detect.

In a democratic republic founded on the principle of freedom of speech, it is already blatantly antithetical to that principle when any government entity is established under the umbrella of a law enforcement body, tasked with determining what the truth is, and investigating certain individuals among those who disagree. But for the official to whom the head of this truth-dictating entity would report to then declare that our lawmakers ought to legislate what can and cannot be said is even more audacious and dangerous. How is this an acceptable stance to take in a nation that, in principle, guarantees free speech? What gives the government the right to determine what speech is “awful” enough to merit censorship? Is this not an open invitation for the government to declare all expression of dissent illegal? Isn’t withholding from the government exactly this power to determine what may and may not be said EXACTLY the point of freedom of speech, and its guarantor the First Amendment to the Constitution? The Democrats have shown that they have contempt for the Constitution in expressing their intent to erode this right.

This latest reiteration of the message discouraging migration (which began with Harris) comes from head of DHS, who is himself a Cuban immigrant. How much more uninviting could the Biden administration be than to make such a statement? And how much more sharply could this possibly contrast with Biden’s campaign promises to open America’s doors wide to asylum seekers? What’s even more revealing is that even though Harris went to Central America months ago to make the same plea as Mayorkas is making now, the US is STILL seeing a record influx of migrants. How desperate does this make the Biden administration look that they are practically begging asylum seekers not to enter the US?

It was Biden who couldn’t (and still can’t) get a handle on inflation, and it was Biden who decided to turn a regional conflict between Russian and Ukraine into a global economic downturn by overseeing a counterproductive sanctions regime. So it is purely on account of Biden’s mismanagement that there is as little faith in the markets as there was when COVID first ravaged the US. How bad does a president have to mismanage the economy for the stock market to look this dour?

How can the DHS seriously claim to enforce our laws if it knowingly allows more than 800,000 people into our country after meeting no legal requirements to enter? How can they possibly ensure the safety of Americans if they allow that many people into the country without concluding the full suite of background checks and approval? The legal immigration process exists for a reason: to ensure that those who enter our country pose no serious threat (as far as that can be known) and are prepared to follow our laws. By circumventing that process when it chooses, the DHS risks that some of these 836,000 people will go on to harm others who live here. No president who does this can then claim that they uphold our nation’s laws.

Wade, a candidate for Florida attorney general (Daniel Uhlfelder) openly called for the armed overthrow of the US government. When pro-Trump protesters broke into the Capitol Building, rioted for a few hours, and went home, the left condemned the incident as an “insurrection”, an attempt at armed overthrow of the US government, despite almost none of them bearing arms (only one person was convicted of possessing a firearm). Since then, the left has called for, and gotten the FBI to conduct, a ruthless prosecution of everyone involved. But when the left declares that they want a “revolution”, an armed overthrow of the government, this is seen as justified and unworthy of condemnation. In other words, for the left, the right can’t so much as mount the mildest riot without being called traitors and coup instigators, but the left can call for as may revolutions as it wants and is never allowed to be criticized. The (prospective) Supreme Court decision is no less legitimate than the certification of the election, yet the left have assumed the right to determine which official government functions are legitimate and which aren’t, while they expect the right to accept all rulings without protest.

To the left’s attack dog press, it is laughable and contemptible to take “horse dewormer” simply because that is the form in which ivermectin, which doctors around the world routinely prescribe to humans, is most readily available without a prescription. And this dismissal of patients’ desperation in taking over-the-counter horse doses of ivermectin is a case in which the medicine is used as intended: as an antiviral medication. But for some reason, the left’s subservient press sees nothing worthy of derision about taking horse ulcer medicine not for human ulcer treatment but for inducing abortions. Yet again, evidence abounds of a double-standard that favors the left at every turn. To the left, their adherents can’t be criticized for taking veterinary medicine even when it is intended to circumvent the criminalization of seeking abortions from medical professionals, but the right can be criticized when its supporters take a treatment to avoid taking a vaccine—actively being forced on them—that they oppose on the grounds of religious belief, moral principle, or bodily autonomy. Again: for the left, safe horse medicine to avoid a vaccine forced on them against their faith or freedoms equals reckless, but taking horse medicine to avoid what may soon be criminal abortion equals totally OK.

How is it that Biden doesn’t think that Russia will consider this a naked act of hostility that could merit direct military retaliation? How would any rational person expect Russia to react to this? Consider how things would play out if the shoe was on the other foot. If the US and Mexico were at war and Russia gave Mexico intel that resulted in the destruction of a US warship, and the death of its sailors, we would regard that as a hostile act on Russia’s part, and consider Russia as a belligerent. Our next move in that theoretical scenario would probably be to bomb Russia. So why do we expect Russia to behave differently when the US provides intel to Ukraine with which the latter kills its (Russia’s) military personnel? As much as Biden says he wants to avoid starting a Third World War, he is certainly recklessly skirting the line at which Russia will be provoked into using military force against the US. And the left had the audacity to declare that Trump was the reckless one who would reel the US into a war. We are closer to a dangerous nuclear war with Russia than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis—perhaps in all of world history.

If the vaccine stopped the spread and prevented COVID so well, why are the most-vaccinated states seeing the sharpest rise in cases (and less-vaccinated states seeing meager upticks or even decreases)?
2022-05-06;https://twitter.com/EthicalSkeptic/status/1522628688252129280;COVID;Figures on rates of cancer diagnosis are off the charts for the year 2022 in the US (via the NCHS, under the CDC), which correlates 6 months to a year out from when most of those Americans who took booster doses of the mRNA “vaccine” took their boosters. What could possibly account for this alarmingly sharp jump in cancer rates if not the mRNA COVID shot? “Vaccine” defenders will likely declare that this increased rate of diagnosis is just a result of Americans, who had cancer at normal rates, going back to the doctor after staying away from healthcare settings during the pandemic.    The data shows that this was certainly true of the year 2020. However, 2021 saw normal (i.e. pre-pandemic) rates of cancer diagnosis, so that means the current surge CAN’T be a compensation for diagnoses missed in 2020—if that were the case, then 2021 would have a surge, not 2022. And the fact that 2021 saw normal rates of cancer diagnosis also proves that Americans also were not still avoiding healthcare facilities—if that were the case, there would be a dip in 2021 just as there was in 2020. So if 2020 cancer numbers were depressed (again, for explicable pandemic-related reasons), 2021 cancer numbers were back to the predicted pre-pandemic rates, and 2022 cancer numbers spiked, what is the cause? It’s one of two things. Either, one, COVID itself leads to higher likelihood of cancer, but remember that COVID cases are surging among the vaccinated so the vaccine is ineffective and they’re getting the same cancer that the unvaccinated who contract COVID are getting. Or two, the vaccine itself leads to higher likelihood of cancer. But if either of these dynamics is possible, consider this: what is more likely to cause cancer, a virus, or instructing every single cell in the human body to make COVID spike proteins that they don’t normally make? It would be interesting to know the percentage of these cancer diagnoses are vaccinated versus unvaccinated. 
2022-05-08;https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1523497334314725379;authoritarianism;Despite Twitter’s insistence that is holds all all verified users to the same standards against advocating violence, it allows left-wing users, even verified ones, to call for attacks against pro-life organizations without imposing any consequences. Commenting on a Molotov cocktail arson attack on the office of a pro-life individual, a Twitter-verified leftist called for more such attacks, and was not suspended or banned from Twitter as a result. Supposedly advocating violence was the justification invoked to ban the verified sitting president of the United States, Trump, from Twitter, and yet this relatively insignificant verified figure was not banned for calling much more explicitly for lethal violence against pro-life individuals and groups. We don’t even have to imagine if the shoe were on the other foot, because an instance in which the ideologies were reversed did in fact play out in the case of Trump. Could it be any clearer that social media pursues a double-standard that benefits the left and punishes the right (or really, anything right of left)?

Yes, the threats to the safety of conservative justices after the leak of a draft anti-abortion Supreme Court opinion are certainly getting coverage. But this reality owes more to the neutral newsworthiness of this incident, and probably (though not necessarily provably) to the left-aligned media’s efforts to help the pro-choice effort in whatever way they can. But those to the right of the left should dare the left to deny that threats against Sotomayor for a draft liberal Supreme Court opinion would get nonstop headline news coverage for days, if not weeks. In fact, the Whitmer kidnapping plot—the majority of those involved being FBI plants, and for which not a single plotter was convicted—provides a prime example of exactly this dynamic. Coverage of this incident persisted for months. Yet now threats to the lives of conservatives justices has now fallen out of the news cycle not one week since they began. How can any rational person deny that the double-standard in our culture and public discourse favors the left?
2022-05-09;https://twitter.com/ycinnewyork/status/1523815787227762688;COVID;The FDA is lowering the efficacy requirements for approving the mRNA COVID “vaccine” in children to below 50%. How is this not concerning to every American who cares for the future of our country? What possible justification could there be to lowering the efficacy requirements to below half, making drugs more likely to be ineffective than effective? This is especially concerning in the case of children. Every drug carries a risk of side effects, especially when the testing period is abbreviated, as it it still in this case when compared to the traditional FDA testing period. So what possible justification can the FDA possibly come up with to risk long-term side effects in children, who are the most susceptible to drug side effects generally, for a drug that is more likely to be ineffective than effective? This is even more questionable considering that children face a minuscule chance of death from COVID. What reason could there be other than serving the pharmaceutical industry which the FDA has been captured by? 
2022-05-10;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1524088835365384193;authoritarianism;The left has so thoroughly given itself over to authoritarianism to enforce its agenda that the potential new owner of Twitter, the richest man in the world, is being condemned for expressing his opposition to using his power to censor those whose speech he facilitates. How is it that leftists make serious claims that they stand for the average American and the working class when they openly call on the powerful to use their power to dominate what Americans can say online? How is it that the left can seriously deny that they are authoritarians when they yearn for the powerful to push around the powerless? And then how can leftists go on to insist that THEY are the ones who value democratic values when they want the powerful to tip the scales of the public discourse, the lifeblood of any democratic society, as they choose? These are all logical outgrowths of the condemnation aimed at Musk for simply expressing that banning Trump from Twitter was a mistake. 
2022-05-10;https://www.axios.com/2022/05/10/firearm-homicide-high-1994;law enforcement;Firearm homicides around the country are at their highest levels in almost 30 years, since 1994. The Democrats lead the way in terms of restrictions on gun ownership everywhere they enjoy control, and they control all the major population centers in America. And yet even though they control every major city and impose tough gun restrictions, gun crimes are soaring in cities more than anywhere. The Democrats are also the ones who back the anti-police policies and have incentivized the police to pull back from doing their job, lest they get fired and prosecuted for using force to stop criminal force. Given these actions, how could there be any other outcome than rising homicides? To whom can we attribute the rise in gun violence but to Democrats? It’s not as though conservatives are going on killing sprees against each other in rural areas. And it’s not as though conservatives are flocking to cities to perpetrate gun crime. Further, propensity for crime is essentially stable in humans—human nature doesn’t fluctuate such (or at all) that criminal intent ticks radically up or down. The only other explanation is that economic downturn correlates with increased violence. But then who was responsible for the economic devastation of the last two years? It wasn’t Republicans, who wanted to keep the economy open once it was clear that lockdowns were useless. It was the Democrats who shut down every state they controlled, and then cut checks to citizens and froze evictions which only incentivized people not to work. It is difficult to argue any other cause for increased gun violence than the Democrats.

Yet again, any thinking person knows that if Trump called on his supporters to protest outside of justices homes, he would be condemned by the Democrats, the left-aligned press, politically active left-aligned companies, and the loud leftists of social media—essentially everyone guaranteed to have a voice online. It is galling that the left has the audacity to deny the existence of the pro-left double-standard in our culture and politics.

The Democrats’ disastrous policies were already driving higher inflation than the US has experienced since the 1980s, and yet they knowingly doubled-down on policies which would drive inflation, ADMITTED as much but that it was the necessary price for aiding Ukraine, and then utterly failed to damage Russia for the inflation it required. How is it that anyone can argue in favor of the Democrats’ competence to lead the economy, and the nation as a whole?

As government accounts are also typically verified, this would mean she wishes for the government to directly assume the power to censor other users. It seems reasonable to assume that conservatives verified account-holders (if there even are any) will be denied this same privilege to edit other users to align with their ideological motives. How can such a naked will to violate the First Amendment by a federal law enforcement agency be tolerated by any American who cherish their rights and a free society? How is it any American can even justify this expressed desire to breach the right to free speech?

This is not considered “effective” by any rational objective measure. Yet Democrats, public health “experts”, and pharma executives still insist that the vaccine is effective. Before the mRNA COVID “vaccines”, what thinking person would have considered a vaccine as “effective” if protection only lasted for a month? Again, how is that effective by any objective metric?
2022-05-16;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1526203538107514884;authoritarianism;After a mass shooter killed predominantly black victims in Buffalo, the media jumped to lump all Republicans in with him despite the fact that, in his manifesto, the shooter condemns “conservatives” and identifies himself as a “left-wing authoritarian”. The Democrats are so desperate to avert a midterm rout, due to their disastrous handling of the economy, that they are falling back on their worn-out tactic of labeling all of their opponents as racists. But this is one level more brazen and dangerous, because Democrat-allied media is openly saying that all Republicans harbor the same violent, extremist beliefs as the shooter in Buffalo who killed nearly a dozen people. There is absolutely no link between the Republican party and a shooter who describes himself as a “left-wing authoritarian”. If anything, that makes him a Democrat, though it would be unfair to make such an association—it could well be possible that the shooter would rebuke the Democrats (likely for not being radical enough by his own metric). If the media were responsible, trustworthy, and non-partisan, why wouldn’t they mention this important detail? Because almost every media entity serves the Democrats. By linking Republicans to deranged mass murderers, the media can inch closer to opening the door to disbanding the Republican party, designating it a terrorist organization, and carrying out a campaign of surveillance, mass arrests, and suppression. How is this, the pursuit of criminalizing an opposing party to create a one-party state, the behavior of democracies? Ironically, the Democrats are becoming the authoritarians they insist they aren’t. 
2022-05-17;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vLIcV_libHY;COVID;Colbert, who took the initial two doses of the mRNA COVID “vaccines” as well as two booster shots, contracted COVID twice in the span of three weeks. How can anyone seriously continue to call the “vaccines” “effective” at this point? In light of anecdotes like this, which are in no short supply, the claim of the shot’s effectiveness is simply laughable. Before the mRNA shots (say, 10 years ago), if you asked people if they would take a vaccine that required two ore more doses, didn’t prevent infection, and didn’t prevent transmission—especially for protection against a disease which is only a little more severe than the flu in terms of symptoms and mortality rate—most would decline for lack of effectiveness. And yet politicians, public health officials, and figures in the media are STILL insisting that a “vaccine” with such pathetic results is effective. The pro-pharma double-standard is also nakedly on display in Colbert’s case. Doctors are prescribing Pfizer’s Paxlovid pill, which has only been tested on the unvaccinated, for vaccinated patients who then get COVID. Certainly, that is their prerogative. But then how is it that the FDA won’t even consider the use of fluvoxamine for treating COVID with the justification of lack of testing? How is it that fluvoxamine is denied approval for use cases for which there has been no testing (treating COVID at all) but Pfizer gets its drugs approved for cases for which there has been no testing (Paxlovid for the vaccinated)? Anyone familiar with the concept of regulatory capture, or who is aware of how much stock in Pfizer politicians own, can probably guess the true motive. Fluvoxamine is not very profitable, as it has been on the market for a while, whereas the new Paxlovid has a high markup since it is new. 
2022-05-18;https://www.axios.com/2022/05/18/supreme-court-abortion-roe-protests-violence;authoritarianism;When the right protests angrily and calls for violence, the Democrats and their loyalist bureaucrats inside the security state race to accuse the right of harboring domestic terrorists, but when the left protests just as aggressively, the Democrats and their faithful security state servants insist that angry protests and calls for violence don’t necessarily mean that the advocates support terrorism. A new report from DHS warns that there could be violence following a Supreme Court ruling on abortion, should the leaked majority opinion be borne out. However, the report throws in superfluous, irrelevant, and partisan jabs at the right by stating that it’s usually the right who protest violently in regards to abortion but that this time (should their predictions come to pass) would be the unusual case of the left getting violent. This is yet another case in which right-wing violence is inflated and left-wing violence is minimized. Every ounce of violence from the January 6 Riots got excessive coverage from the media, yet Antifa’s militant seizure of Portland streets and the orgy of violence during the Floyd Protests (turned riots) got a bare minimum of coverage. This present case is immensely more perilous, though: the double-standard is not being advanced by the media or politicians who exert power mainly through rhetoric, but by a domestic federal law enforcement agency which exercises investigatory and prosecutorial discretion. When the DHS downplays left violence and exaggerates right violence, it has real-world consequences: more surveillance and arrests of politically right protesters and more overlooking of politically left protesters. Is it even possible for anyone to credibly deny that the right is in the security state’s cross-hairs while even the most radical left-wingers are allowed to escape? 
2022-05-18;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61488556;election;Federal prosecutors are asserting that Clinton lawyer Sussman lied to the FBI by not disclosing that he worked for the Democrats when furnishing supposed (since debunked) evidence that Trump was colluding with Russia. In the interest of advancing discourse based on evidence and rationality—something the left has no interest in doing, if this document has demonstrated anything— this claim by prosecutors has not been proven in court, and so it would be unfair to state unequivocally that Sussman lied to the FBI. That being said, prosecutors typically don’t pursue cases unless they are confident they can get a jury to convict on the charges filed. This goes doubly for a prosecution against a Democrat, as the Justice Department is currently headed by a Biden appointee and most FBI agents lean politically left. So the fact that the left-leaning Justice Department thinks Sussman lied to them means it is pretty strongly convinced of this assertion. Time and a jury verdict will tell if they are right. 
2022-05-18;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1526928947694510080;authoritarianism;Yet again, a credentialed official in the Democrats’ orbit is calling for the Republican party to be criminalized based on the mistaken belief that the Buffalo shooter was ideologically aligned with the Republicans. As stated before, rhetoric like this is designed to prime Americans into tolerating the security state’s persecution of the left’s political opponents. In other words, it is meant to slowly move the Overton Window closer to left-wing authoritarianism (ironically, the point on the political spectrum the Buffalo shooter himself claimed to occupy). It is clear to any thinking person that if a pro-right pundit called for the Democrats to be criminalized, even in this case in which the shooter actually did see himself as on the far left, that the media would utterly condemn the intimation. 
2022-05-19;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1526974451987931136;authoritarianism;Another pro-left pundit on the same segment as the above called for those who express “misinformation”, activity which is protected under the First Amendment, to be prosecuted and imprisoned. This is an outrageous proposal, and flies in the face of the most sacred and vital democratic values. Democracy is not possible without the right to unrestricted debate. As soon as the state has the power to criminalize “misinformation”, it will immediately begin labeling speech which threatens its power as such. Criminalizing speech, any speech, is the most direct route to tyranny. Consider who occupies the White House, and thus whose speech would be criminalized. Which party would benefit most from this? And consider the context of these remarks, as well. These calls to criminalize speech only emerge whenever “dangerous” speech is allegedly politically right in origin. No one ever calls for reining in misinformation when the left is its author. Did anyone call for cracking down on misinformation against the Russiagate proponents when the Trump-Russia collusion accusation was proven to be false? Did anyone call for curtailing misinformation against those who denied that the Hunter Biden laptop story was true once the New York Times corroborated its authenticity? No, because this misinformation serves the Democrats. So even if we, as a nation, cave to the criminalization of speech—which no American should consent to, not against the right, not against the left, not against anyone—it is clear that that will only be wielded against the right, and not equally against all peddlers of untruths.
2022-05-18;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX9j4GLQhLo;COVID;Data from Walgreens shows that a HIGHER percentage of vaccinated people tested for COVID test positive than unvaccinated people. Specifically, of all unvaccinated individuals Walgreens tested, 21% tested positive for COVID. Yet of all individuals tested who received 2 mRNA doses longer than 5 months ago, 31% of them tested positive for COVID. For those who received 3 mRNA doses longer than 5 months ago, the number is actually slightly higher (32%). How can anyone claim the “vaccine” is effective when there is a higher case rate among the vaccinated than unvaccinated? How much more evidence is needed to get the holdouts to admit it’s not working? And most importantly, what business does ANY leader have in mandating vaccines when they are demonstrably worse than useless?
2022-05-26;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61588274;law enforcement;The left spent the last few years criticizing police for rushing in with weapons too eagerly, but after a school shooting complain that police did not react fast enough. Reports from the shooting in Uvalde, Texas indicate that police waited 40 minutes before entering the school to confront the assailant. This was obviously an egregious mistake, and one that police in Uvalde have owned up to without making excuses (as they should). But it is still galling that the left has spent the last few years pursuing criminal charges against practically every case of a police officer using a weapon in the course of duty that makes it into the media, and is then surprised when police aren’t quick to run in with guns drawn during an active shooter incident. What did they expect to happen? If you deincentivize—with firings and prosecution—law enforcement to draw weapons on duty, then they will overcorrect and fail to do so when it is clear to rational people that they should. But even in this tragic failure to do their duty, unless police are fired for not drawing their weapons and intervening in Uvalde, this behavior will continue. Like any employees, police will do whatever is least likely to get them fired. And what is plain to see today, in the midst of the largest year-on-year increase in crime in American history, is that police have figured out the left’s rules, and the rules are thus: if you draw your weapon, no matter how justified, you get fired and possibly prosecuted, but if you keep your weapon holstered and fall back, no matter how contrary to reason and the public good, you keep your job. These are the rules the left made. Those who dislike these rules have no recourse except to confront the left. In fairness to honest rational discourse, one cannot conflate correlation with causation. Just because this failure to act occurred in a political context of aggressive punishment of a police for use of deadly force does not mean that that was the reason that officers in Uvalde didn’t intervene. But are you 100% certain that the left’s new rules for law enforcement played NO role whatsoever? Do you really want to take the chance that this political climate had NO impact on the tragedy that played out in Uvalde? Would you bet innocent human life on it? No way, nor should you. 
2022-05-26;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61575387;foreign policy;The World Bank is warning that the price for the Democrats’ dangerous, potentially nuclear proxy war against Russia in Ukraine is a global recession. Thought leaders in the Democrats’ (ad fellow neoconservative Republicans’) orbit have openly indicated that the aim of US policy with respect to Ukraine is not to help Ukraine prevail quickly over Russia, but to keep Russia bogged down in Ukraine for as long as possible. This policy is already callous and psychopathic, using Ukrainian lives as pawns in America’s game, on its own. But then, setting aside the flirtation with Russian nuclear retaliation, add to that the fact that the proxy war could well lead to a worldwide economic recession and it is clear that the Democrats are so obsessed with Russia that they don’t care what price they or anyone else has to pay. Is this the mark of level-headed leaders? Was it not the Democrats who accused Trump of carelessly destabilizing the world and begetting economic damage? And yet now the Democrats are doing all that they swore Trump had committed.  
2022-05-30;https://www.axios.com/2022/05/30/us-population-growth-arizona-texas-florida;authoritarianism;There is a tidal wave of Americans migrating to Arizona, Texas, and Florida, states have for the most part taken a very publicly hard line against the Democrat political and economic agendas. The Democrats love to brag about how the regions they govern have the most vibrant economies and the greatest degrees of freedom, but if that were true then why would Americans be flocking to areas controlled by Republicans? What’s more, these are places that scientists say will be most adversely impacted by climate change. Clearly, the fact that there is such a massive influx of Americans to these places signals that climate change is less of a concern to them than economic opportunity and civil liberties. In stark contrast to Democrats’ claims that their economies are superior, these states have truly thriving economies (as much as is possible under Biden’s disastrous federal economic policies) because they were shut down for COVID for the shortest span of time, as their leaders recognized that lockdowns caused economic devastation—which comes with adverse health outcomes as second-order consequences—for next to no reduction in COVID cases. It turns out that most Americans care about the economy more than anything else, and freedoms after that. The Democrats have proven that they are unable to safeguard either, so it should come as no surprise that Americans are fleeing to places that do a better job on both counts. 
2022-05-30;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-61627316;foreign policy;The US is giving Ukraine weapons it doesn’t need which only have the effect of backing Russia into a corner. Recently, the US said it would give long-range MLRS missiles to Ukraine, ostensibly for fighting Russia. But if the entire nature of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is that Russia is invading Ukraine, then why does Ukraine need long-range missiles? Aren’t the offending Russian units in or bordering Ukrainian territory? If the enemy is within or near your borders, why do you need long-range weaponry? Part of Russia’s casus belli is that the US is turning Ukraine into a forward base from which to attack Russia. Providing Ukraine with MLRS missiles only lends credence to Russia’s claims and magnifies its fears, reinforcing its resolve to fight on in Ukraine. This is the very definition of escalation, which Biden swore was too dangerous to allow. It sure seems as though Biden is not as committed to preventing escalation as he claims. Literally, Biden is pushing Russia closer and closer to a nuclear response, all while denying that that is a possible outcome. Is is possible for an American president to be much more reckless than that? And again, this is the same carelessness that Democrats accused Trump of, but actually being borne out by their own president. 
2022-05-31;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-61642217;foreign policy;China is sending a huge number of warplanes into Taiwanese airspace, signaling that they aren’t afraid of US threats to defend Taiwan. There is essentially no other way to interpret this response, (flying warplanes through Taiwanese defensive space) to Biden’s recent declaration of US commitment to defending Taiwan than to conclude that China is not scared. Clearly, China is either not convinced that the US will stand by its promise, or that China estimates US military capability to be so meager that even US military intervention is not considered to be a major threat to Chinese expansionist ambitions. More specifically, this is a reflection of China’s perception of Biden. China was not so brazen as to send this many military aircraft into Taiwan’s airspace under Trump. It is clear that China smells weakness, and it is coming directly from Biden.

Specifically, at the peak of the Omicron wave in March of this year, of those in the oldest age demographic, 40% of those who died from COVID were vaccinated. How can anyone stare this figure in the face and still argue that the “vaccines” are effective? What rational person would say that the “vaccines” work when 2 vaccinated people in the most vulnerable age group die for every 3 unvaccinated who die? In what world is that considered “effective”? Anyone continuing to advocate the “vaccine”, especially public health officials and elected officeholders, needs to explain with empirical data how these vaccines are effective to justify the unknown long-term risk the “vaccines” pose. 
2022-06-01;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/01/coronavirus-vaccine-omicron-variants;COVID;The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 is mutating so rapidly that new “vaccines” retooled to its genetic material are not able to keep pace. This is yet another nail in the coffin that the “vaccines” against COVID simply aren’t effective. One, there would be no need to create Omicron-optimized shots if the existing ones were effective against Omicron, so that alone suggests that the existing mRNA treatments from Pfizer and Moderna are ineffective. Two, the rapid mutation of the virus shows the folly in pursuing a vaccination strategy over a treatment strategy for fighting COVID. The flu provides an illustrative example of the challenges of fighting a mutating virus, as flu vaccine synthesis is a constant struggle that is not always effective for a given year. And note that the flu is a virus that goes through annual seasonal cycles of mutation. COVID, on the other hand, strikes in semiannual waves (twice a year), so the rate of mutation is likely also higher (i.e. as it adapts to the human immune  systems it encounters). It’s time for public health and elected officials to admit that the COVID “vaccines” were a failure, so that we can instead invest time and money into alternatives that actually work. 
2022-06-02;https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/02/nakasone_us_hacking_russia;foreign policy;Once again, the US is admitting that it is directly antagonizing Russia, this time via offensive cyber operations, as a belligerent in the Russia-Ukraine War, inching closer to Russian retaliation against the US. High-ranking US military officials have openly stated that the US launched offensive military hacking operations against Russia to aid Ukraine. Depending on the damage wrought by the operations, this is tantamount to declaring that US special forces launched a strike against Russian military assets. Is the Biden administration really so sure that Russia will not consider this an act of war and retaliate against the US? How does any rational person estimate that Russia will react to an open admission of offensive operations against them? And how does this provocative act square with Biden’s vow to avert “World War III”? It is becoming clearer by the day that the Biden administration is dangerously inconsistent and recklessly provocative.

So, basically, to the supposedly “respectable” pro-Democrat media, anything that challenges their partisan agenda is anti-democratic. Ironically, it is THIS statement attempting to suppress dissent that is anti-democratic. But of course, this irony is of no concern to the political left. They will say and do anything, even censorship and political persecution, to disqualify and silence their foes. By contrast, it is rare to find comparable figures on the right stating that the left should not be allowed to express its views—they simply challenge the ethics and efficacy of the stated views, as they should (and as should happen in the reverse political orientation). It is ONLY on the left that the prevailing establishment view (to say nothing of the radical left’s view) is that the right’s speech should not be tolerated.

She likely said what she did to distance herself from Biden, implying that her best efforts were not able to overcome Biden’s disastrous handling of the economy. When the rats start jumping off the burning ship, it is evident that the state of affairs is truly dire. 
2022-06-07;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/07/housing-affordability-collapse;economy;The yearlong period from 2021 to 2022 was the fastest decrease in home affordability on record in America, at a 29% decrease. How does this square with the Democrats’ policy position of providing affordable housing for all? Either the Democrats lied and they have no intention of pursuing affordable housing, or they are so inept that they not only fail to implement their policy but regress further in the opposite direction than ever (as far back as the data goes). But then again, what can expect from the party that enjoys more donations from billionaires than any other? 
2022-06-08;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/08/kavanaugh-supreme-court-threat-arrest;authoritarianism;Mere weeks after the leaked supposed majority Supreme Court opinion overturning Roe v. Wade, which would have the effect of allowing states to criminalize abortion, a man was arrested and charged with attempting to kill Justice Kavanaugh. The timing of this could not be more embarrassing for the Democrats, as they insisted in the wake of the Buffalo shooting that only the right commits political violence. What other possible motive could Kavanaugh’s attempted murderer have, considering Kavanaugh was one of the Justices who supposedly backed the leaked majority opinion, than by violently reducing the vote count in a case which would threaten the left’s sacred cow that is abortion? How can the Democrats deny any longer that their side just as readily embraces political violence as the Republicans’ side? Every political faction has radicals who will resort to violence. But whereas the Republicans acknowledge and condemn when their radicals commit violence, the Democrats deny any shared ideology with left-wing extremists and instead gaslight the country into thinking only the right extremists commit violence, so they can further censor and sujugate the right. 
2022-06-08;https://twitter.com/JerryDunleavy/status/1534563536118198273;authoritarianism;The Democrats’ handmaidens, the media, are so desperate to maintain the lie that only the right has extremists who perpetrate political violence that even as its chyron indicates that a man was arrested with a weapon near Kavanaugh’s house, the CNN anchor equivocated and suggested that the arrestee may not have had a weapon. This is the kind of gaslighting that the Democrats project onto Republicans, but which the Democrats truly excel at more than any other political faction. Literally despite the fact of Kavanaugh’s assailant’s possession of a weapon being established—this is typically a detail that is only available from police, and which the police only state on the public record when they are certain of its veracity—CNN still cast doubt on this fact. Only loyal partisan vassals would have any reason to prostitute their journalistic integrity to try to hide a fact that is nigh irrefutable. But this just goes to show how (almost) wholly the media bends the knee to the Democrats, as much as they protest to the contrary. 
2022-06-09;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/09/inflation-data-cpi-new-research;economy;Only now, months into the worst inflation in at least 40 years, is it being reported what any average American could tell you, which is that inflation is worse than the government’s calculated rate of around 8%. Only the wealthy Democrat politicians, who have underlings to buy food and home essentials for them, can delude themselves into thinking that the current runaway inflation is just a modest tick up in prices. For some of the most critical household goods, inflation is well into the double-digit percentages. But of course, leave it to the Biden administration to downplay what a disastrous job it is doing. It is only through reporting like this that the real toll inflation is taking on Americans begins to be fully understood. 
2022-06-10;https://www.theregister.com/2022/06/10/russia_china_usa_ukraine_cyberdefense/;foreign policy;China and Russia are preparing their pretext for retaliatory cyberattacks against the US for its direct offensive cyber operations against Russia. Granted, rhetoric like this is very often just empty saber-rattling. Even so, China and Russia will be able to claim that they gave the US due advance warning of retaliatory responses to US offensive cyber operations against them. This statement is also proof of just how thoroughly the US has pushed Russia into the arms of China. By trying to sap Russia’s strength by miring it in its conflict with Ukraine, the US risks nuclear war all just to hobble a second-rate power—Russia’s economy is smaller than Italy’s—with little global geopolitical relevance. Russia would have been much more useful as a Western wedge against China: even though Russia would have been unlikely to become a friendly pro-Western power, it could at least see the wisdom in joining forces with the West to diminish an ascendant superpower (China) on its border. Instead, the US threw that away and instead reinforced China’s position by giving it another nuclear-armed ally as a land buffer between it and Western Europe. This the kind of failure of imagination and an egregious mishandling of American foreign policy that could ONLY occur under the arrogant, myopic leadership of the Democrats’ leading minds. 
2022-06-10;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/10/cdc-covid-test-requirement-air-travel;COVID;The CDC is ending its COVID testing requirements for foreign travelers to the US, but employees of the federal government and many of its contractors are still required to be vaccinated to keep their jobs. How is it that the government’s foremost public health body believes that travelers from overseas pose so little risk of spreading COVID that testing is unnecessary, but the federal government still makes employees vaccinate for fear of spreading COVID (even though, as is well-proven now, the mRNA “vaccines” don’t stop the spread of COVID)? Why is our government holding its own citizens to stricter standards, and infringing more egregiously on individual freedom, than foreigners? Why does the US government prize the freedom of non-Americans more highly than Americans?

2022-06-14;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/14/monkeypox-rename-who-name-racism;identity;The left once again proves that THEY are the racists by being the only party in political discourse making an offensive racial association, so they can pat themselves on the back for supposedly addressing it. The left is insisting that monkeypox be renamed because it is racist against black people. But as any true non-discriminatory person can tell you, there is no intrinsic link between monkeys and black people. It is only those who seek to draw a link who are the real racists. For the overwhelming majority of Americans, there is no such link. Monkeys are monkeys. Black people are people. This is widely understood and accepted. For the left to say that monkeypox, which bears no connection with black people, is racist against black people only reveals that it is the LEFT that sees an derogatory link between monkeys, a pox which bears their name, and black people. Consider who the real racist is, the group that views black people, monkeys, and monkeypox as unrelated (normal, non-leftists), or the group that insists that there is a relationship and that it is negative (the left)? This is a classic case of psychological projection: the left is accusing others who exhibit no racial animus of the racism that is seething within their own ranks. Find any remarks suggesting that black people are inferior and most (if not all) of the time you will be able to trace their origin or reinforcement back to a Democrat.
2022-06-17;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-61835919;economy;Biden openly admitted that Americans are, on the whole, feeling dejected. It is, to say the least, highly uncommon for presidents to speak in these terms. They typically will frame the state of the nation and the spirit of its people optimistically and aspirationally. That Biden is saying something so contrary is telling. In fairness to Biden, it may well be that most presidents sugarcoat the state of the country and he has instead elected to be honest. If this is in fact his angle, that would be commendable. In spite of whatever candor he may be trying to engender, the fact remains that Americans are dispirited, and it is his policies which have gotten them there. Americans were already weary from a pandemic which neither party had a hand in unleashing (at least directly). But the Democrats have done seemingly everything they can to chip away at what flagging morale Americans had left: the Democrats shut down the country for years, which smothered small businesses, drove up drug abuse, drove up domestic violence, drove up rates of mental illness and suicide rates, and stunted the development of a generation of children. And then to make matters worse, the Democrats then spearheaded the effort to print trillions of dollars, some of which went directly to individual American citizens but most of which went to corporations, which has driven inflation to record levels. So, yes, Americans ARE “really, really down”, and the Democrats have kicked Americans while they’re down at every turn. 
2022-06-22;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/22/fed-chair-jerome-powell-inflation-recession;economy;Biden’s Fed Chair is saying that it’s a “possibility” that the US will enter a recession, clearly ignorant of how very clearly the country is in a recession already. Inflation is at its highest in 40 years and still climbing. The market is trending down across the board. Small businesses have been decimated by the ineffective pandemic lockdowns, destroying the livelihoods of millions of Americans.  Food shortages are commonplace. The national debt has leapt up trillions of dollars in the course of only a few years. How is this NOT a recession? The Biden administration is clearly completely unmoored from reality, and the plight of ordinary Americans, despite insisting that they, as Democrats, stand up for the little guy. All the Democrats have accomplished in the last few years is plunging small businesses into financial oblivion and transferring trillions in taxpayer dollars to their corporate donors.
2022-06-23;https://mobile.twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1541139630631931906;election;The Democrats are continuing to bewail the supposed danger of Republicans questioning the validity of the 2020 election despite the fact that dozens of Democrats spent minutes of aggregate airtime stating explicitly that Trump was an “illegitimate president” after his victory in 2016. A 10-minute video is circulating on social media of Democrats stating without reservation that Trump was not duly and fairly elected, that the election was stolen from Clinton in 2016. But because the Democrats have their media allies to control the public discourse, the Democrats get a pass on impugning the integrity of a presidential election. In their view, the Democrats have every right to insist on the illegitimacy of any election they lose, whereas the Republicans must accept every election loss as fair and beyond reproach, with any dissent or questioning constituting treason. This dangerous double-standard has been allowed to extend to the most vital characteristic of our democracy: the right to pursue proof that an election was conducted fairly, wherein the winner can prove their victory to the satisfaction of all reasonable doubters. To the Democrats, this ultimate of all rights is reserved only for them, denied to all their foes. What kind of democratic republic does that make? 
2022-06-24;https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-flashes-extremely-simple-cue-card-instructions-at-meeting-2022-6;mental fitness;Biden accidentally revealed a cue card replete with reminders to perform basic, intuitive functions like sitting down. The card featured instructions such as  “YOU take YOUR seat”, “YOU thank participants”, and “YOU depart”. These are the kind of instructions you would have to give a small child, not ones which should be necessary for the elected leader of the most powerful nation on Earth. How is it that anyone can claim that Biden is in full possession of his mental faculties when he requires written instructions like this? Trump, as inept as he was, was never caught with anything like this. The same people who said Trump was not mentally equipped to be president are rushing to defend Biden in spite of even more definitive proof of Biden’s mental decline than Trump’s. Once again, the Democrats’ psychological projection is hard at work: they accuse the Republicans of what they themselves are far more guilty.
2022-06-24;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/24/violent-extremism-roe-wade-abortion-dhs-memo;authoritarianism;DHS is warning that there will likely be “violent extremism” in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down Roe v. Wade, allowing states to make their own determinations regarding the legality of abortions. If one thinks rationally about this, it is clear who will be the perpetrator of this violence. Which side has a greater motive for violence, the side who got their way in this ruling (the right) or the side that didn’t (the left)? This is clear to a moderately intelligent 9-year-old. The left, having lost in the legal arena, has no option left but to pursue extralegal means for securing their right to abort fetuses. Of course, this is yet more evidence of just how inclined toward violence the extremists on the left are. Over and over mainstream left figures and their media ally pundits have insisted that ONLY the right pursues political violence, and that furthermore this fiction is grounds to suppress all politically right discourse. Does anyone think for even one second that the media will discuss the urgent need to censor the left to stop left-wing political violence—violence warned by a Democrat administration’s DHS—the way that the media immediately insists on censoring the right to stop right-wing violence? Of course not. That’s because to the left and nearly all of the media, principle and the evenhanded administration of justice means nothing to them. The only thing that matters is securing their agenda, and they will impose any double-standard in service of that end. 
2022-06-26;https://www.axios.com/2022/06/26/warren-supreme-court-abortion;authoritarianism;A prominent Democrat senator is calling for the destruction of the Supreme Court by packing the bench until the Democrats get their way. Until now, both parties have had the sense to respect the tradition of keeping the Supreme Court at a static number of seats. But now the Democrats are so desperate to have their way that they are willing to upend centuries of tradition and warp the court into what is essentially the president’s rubber stamp body. Consider the situation rationally. If a Democrat president appoints more leftist justices until the left wins every court case, are Republicans just going to sit and take it, ceding permanent control of the courts to the Democrats? Once the Democrats open the door to court packing, what’s stopping them from doing it again? Why would they risk the Supreme Court ever defying them when they have the power to pack the bench whenever they want? So against this backdrop, why would Republicans just let the Democrats do this and control the Supreme Court forever? The Republicans will have to play ball, packing the bench with their own conservative justices. What would result is that the Supreme Court will simply be tipped in favor of whichever party controls the White House: whenever a new party wins the presidency, that new president will add justices until they have a majority on the court. Thus, the Supreme Court, the Judicial Branch of the federal government, will lose all autonomy, and instead of being a co-equal branch of government with the Legislative Branch and Executive Branch it will simply become a subservient instrument of the Executive Branch. Why would the Founding Fathers create the Supreme Court as a separate branch of government if it simply served the whims of the president? What would have been the point in defining the Supreme Court as a distinct entity separate from the President? It very quickly becomes apparent to anyone capable of reasoning that the idea of arbitrarily expanding the Supreme Court, as Warren (and, probably soon more prominent Democrats) defiles the very essence of a democratic republic that the Founding Fathers envisioned. Even worse, should they accomplish this debasement of the court, it would lead to tyrannical abuses the likes of which most Americans could never comprehend. What happens when a president who controls the Supreme Court simply rules by decree, deprives any American of all their freedoms at will, and deploys the military might of a world superpower to crush all dissent? Does anyone think a Supreme Court in such a state would stop the president? The president also has the power to dismiss Congress, and can make appointments without Congressional approval if Congress is not in session, so even Congress’s check could easily be bypassed. If the Supreme Court is allowed to be profaned as Warren suggests, it will mark the irreversible beginning of a tyrannical presidency in our country. 
2022-06-28;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/06/28/chicagoans-getting-unsettling-anonymous-texts-with-a-map-of-their-address-urging-them-to-vote/;election;Some Chicago residents received anonymous election reminder texts revealing the location of their homes. In Chicago, there is essentially no electoral activity from Republicans: the vast majority of candidates on the ballot in Chicago are Democrat, with the rest being leftist third-parties or independents. So which party is most likely by far to have produced and sent these texts? The third-parties and independents don’t have the resources to acquire location data for potential voters. Not only does the Democratic Party have their own huge voter database (separate from the government-maintained official voter rolls), but they also have an enormous financial margin against all other parties (to say nothing of their utter dwarfing of independents). Location data is not cheap, and must be bought from data miners in bulk, so it could have only realistically been the Democrats which sent out these creepy text messages. Does it not alarm citizens that a political party possesses such sensitive data about them? How is it that ANY party should be allowed to handle and disseminate voters’ location data? SMS text messages are trivially easy to intercept, as they are not encrypted. So any adversary looking to stalk a given individual could have simply intercepted these messages, which link a phone number to an address (and possibly more). This is only one example of how this data could be abused. Who knows the other ways in which the possessors of this data are using it without citizens’ knowledge or consent? 
2022-06-39;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXz00W_ATyc;COVID;Fauci, the highest-profile “vaccine” apologist imaginable, has come down with COVID twice in the span of a couple of weeks despite receiving 4 doses of the jab and a full course of Paxlovid. Fauci has maintained for the entire lifetime of the mRNA COVID immune therapy that it is extremely effective, that there is nearly no chance a “vaccinated” individual will contract COVID, and that therefore everyone should take it. And yet he has received 4 doses of the treatment, contracted COVID, took a full course of the Paxlovid pill, and contracted COVID again only days after beginning treatment via Paxlovid. After his bout with COVID ran its course, he credited Paxlovid, stating that his illness would have been more severe had it not been for Paxlovid. Strangely, he did not credit the “vaccine” at all for surviving COVID. Why? He has maintained its significant efficacy even as data shows it does little to nothing against Omicron (the strain which is now predominant in the US, and therefore which he almost certainly contracted). If the “vaccine” is so effective, how come he didn’t cite it, along with Paxlovid, as one of the reasons why he survived COVID despite being in his 80s? The other notable element of this story is that this is yet another instance of an individual who is highly dosed with the mRNA immune therapy catching COVID anyway, taking Paxlovid for it, and then contracting a “rebound” case of COVID after the Paxlovid treatment. Again, Paxlovid was only officially tested on the unvaccinated (for submission for FDA approval, which it subsequently got). In this testing, “rebound” cases were quite rare. However, when prescribed for vaccinated individuals—which is technically an “off-label” prescription—rebound cases appear to be surprisingly common. As Iverson cited, there are instances in which families of quadruple-jabbed individuals all experience Paxlovid-linked rebound cases, which is extremely unlikely if such cases are a rarity. And yet even as this supposedly rare side effect is manifesting quite commonly, there have been no calls to take Paxlovid off the market or advise doctors against prescribing it to the vaccinated. This again shows the suspicious pro-”vaccine” bias at work. The unvaccinated are condemned for taking extremely safe drugs off-label to treat COVID (i.e. ivermectin), yet the vaccinated are not chided in the slightest for taking a drug off-label (i.e. Paxlovid) which has an apparent correlation with a side effect which is rare in on-label prescriptions (i.e. prescribed for the unvaccinated). If public health officials fulfilled their duties as intended, and without bias, they would be investigating the possible dangers associated with the vaccinated taking Paxlovid. But it is clear that such principled officials are not in the majority in our public health institutions. Instead, these institutions favor those citizens who comply with their dictates—dictates to take an experimental immune therapy—and persecute those citizens who resist, on penalty of deprivation of basic freedoms. 
2022-07-01;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/07/01/google-abortion-delete-history-00043841;authoritarianism;Google cares about the privacy of liberals, while conservatives enjoy no such right to privacy. Google has stated that it will voluntarily delete the location data of women who seek abortions. Indeed, no one seeking a legal medical procedure should have their whereabouts tracked. But of course, this privacy protection is not extended to anyone else, since Google’s is one of the most liberal-concentrated workforces anywhere in the world. Conservatives will get their location data tracked if they go to a place of worship, seek addiction treatment for opioids, or exercise their First Amendment rights to protest Democrats’ policies. This just goes to show that, because leftists have seized most of the major levers of cultural, technological, and political power in the nation, they are free to wield their power to shield their adherents and persecute everyone else. Google, one could well imagine, will not shed a tear if a tyrannical Democrat asks them for identifying data on everyone who peacefully protested their policies. But even if a jurisdiction outlawed abortion by majority vote, and a legally authorized warrant were served to them, Google will not comply with state attempts to enforce the law. Google is likely within its rights to do so. But the partisan manner in which it chooses to exercise those rights demonstrates just how completely the left imposes its will on the nation. 
2022-07-03;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miYpVArLiQc;authoritarianism;A number of pregnancy centers which do not offer abortions were firebombed in retaliation for the Supreme Court opening the door to states outlawing abortions if they so choose. The left routinely claims that only the right commits political violence, with some going so far as to label the entire Republican Party as a “terrorist organization”. And yet here are more than a dozen incidents of ostensibly liberals setting fire to pregnancy centers and churches as political acts. The left has no business claiming that the right is the only violent political faction. If anything, if we tally the score, it seems like the left is more violent than the right. Whereas the members of the right were responsible for the Charlottesville rioting, Dylan Roof’s attack on black churchgoers, and the Capitol Riots (in which only rioters died, and inflicted more symbolic than real injury), and perhaps the odd mass shooting, members of the left were responsible for the attempted killing of Republican Congressmen at a softball practice, the slow-burn of Antifa street violence in Portland and Seattle, the nationwide riots following the George Floyd protests, the riots in Kenosha following the Jacob Blake protests, the New York subway shooting by a radical left black separatist (i.e. black supremacist), and the shooting of mostly black shoppers in Buffalo (committed by a self-described “left-wing authoritarian”). Viewed in this light, it would seem that yet again the left is projecting onto the right the penchant for violence that the left itself harbors but does not want to admit. Certainly, a propensity for violence does not describe the majority of adherents to left or right ideology—most leftists and rightists do not condone violence—but the left should not so freely accuse others of misdeeds which it is more guilty of. 
2022-07-03;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miYpVArLiQc;authoritarianism;In the wake of states moving to criminalize abortion after the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the federal government is moving to circumvent those states’ laws by facilitating access to abortion pills nationwide. It is an brazen overreach and abuse of power by the federal government to help citizens circumvent laws in their states simply because the federal government does not like those states’ laws. According to the Federalist papers, and provisions in the constitution itself, sovereignty resides with the states, and the citizens of states reserve the right to govern themselves as they choose (via their elected state representatives). What right does the federal government have to decide what state laws a state should be able to effectively enforce? How is it not the very definition of tyranny to intervene in the self-government of a sovereign body to negate its enforcement of its own legitimate laws? There are legal means for the federal government to pursue its aims of mandating all states provide abortion procedures, such as amending the US constitution and thus superseding state laws, but the federal government is not pursuing these legal avenues. Instead it is infringing on state sovereignty and freedom from arbitrary meddling by the federal executive, in violation of a check from the federal judiciary. This galling behavior should alarm anyone who values individual liberties in this country. But of course, those who claim to defend rights most zealously, those on the left, are cheering as the federal government thwarts state sovereignty. 
2022-07-03;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miYpVArLiQc;economy;The US is officially in a recession by textbook economic definition, as the nation experienced two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. The Democrats swore they were such superior stewards of the economy compared to the Republicans, and yet with COVID restrictions lifted and the lethality of the disease much reduced from its peak, the economy is still struggling. Biden’s administration has maintained up until now that the nation is not in a recession, so we’ll see if they maintain this delusional line or if they accede to the reality of events. 
2022-07-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1543641777218928643;identity;Yet again, liberals prove that they’re the racist ones by implying that they don’t think non-white people are capable of showing up to important meetings on time. When a liberal bureaucrat pushed back a scheduled meeting of a state governmental body, she justified it by stating that “urgency is a white supremacy value”, implying that of course non-whites could not be expected to act on any sense of urgency on any topic, even topics which concern them intimately. Any normal, moral person in this multicultural country of ours can tell you that of course anyone of any race can experience a sense of urgency in regard to some issue. Only the left is arguing that certain races aren’t capable of urgency, or just intrinsically have no interest in urgency. Urgency is a trait anyone of any background can INDIVIDUALLY choose to embrace or reject. To tie it to race is the very definition of racism—only the left has done so, and worse, they hold it up their racism as racially enlightened virtue.
2022-07-03;https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/bezos-slams-bidens-call-gasoline-stations-cut-prices-2022-07-03/;economy;Biden’s latest tactic for bringing down gas prices is to literally just ask companies to charge less money, betraying the fact that he doesn’t have any better ideas. Bezos, who leans left politically and has supported the Democrats heavily, even criticized Biden for clearly demonstrating his inability to understand basic economics. Does Biden really think that, at a time when Americans are crying out for cheaper gas, all petroleum companies have formed an ad hoc cartel to fix gas prices? First of all, if they did, the Biden administration could simply prosecute them and not only bring down prices but extract billions in damages which would go straight into the Treasury. And second of all, if every petroleum company fixed high prices, wouldn’t the one company that brought prices down reap huge profits as every consumer flocked to them? So the fact that prices are high very likely has nothing to do with petroleum companies just being blindly greedy, in a coordinated way where no single company steps out of line to reap immense rewards. 
2022-07-04;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/04/highland-park-shooting-july-4-parade;law enforcement;After every mass shooting the left immediately tries to pin it to the right, but if that’s the game the left wants to play, in regards to the most recent attack on a Fourth of July parade, 5 minutes of reasoning will make it clear that, if the shooter had ANY political alignment—a huge and unlikely if—it was on the left. It is most likely that the shooter was not politically motivated, and that he simply took advantage of the holiday’s large outdoor gathering of people in close proximity. However, IF there is a political dimension, it is almost certainly left, not right. Which side of the spectrum views the American flag as a symbol of racism and oppression? The left. To which political faction did the last few shooters belong, of those who had political leanings (the Buffalo shooter, the New York subway shooter)? The left. What political demographic do those with neon-colored dyed hair and an obsession with rap and stardom, as the shooter in Highland Park had, overwhelmingly belong to? The left. Although the site of the attack is a liberal town with a large Jewish population, none of the shooter’s social media content nor any evidence collected from his home indicate any antisemitism. And of course, there’s the fact that he executed the attack on Independence Day, the single most sacred day of the year for conservatives (even more so than Christmas, as not all conservatives are Christian, but they almost all hold immense pride in the nation). Again, it’s most likely that the shooter was just a troubled young man whose friends and family ignored blatant red flags. But if there IS a political dimension, the case is strong that it is left. 
2022-07-05;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/07/05/fireworks-thrown-at-police-squad-cars-in-scenes-captured-on-video/;law enforcement;Crowds in Chicago threw fireworks at police on the Fourth of July, once again demonstrating that the left has a casual, shockingly common, homicidal contempt for law enforcement. In media coverage of these incidents, the media seems to forget that explosives of any kind are deadly. What transpired in Chicago over the Fourth of July weekend was nothing less than people attempting to inflict fatal injury on police officers deployed to keep everyone safe. Again, though the political leaning was not stated explicitly, a 9-year-old could easily reason this out: it is significantly more likely that the side that chants “ACAB” (“all cops are bastards”) threw the fireworks than the side that rallies around “Blue Lives Matter”. What is most alarming is how casual these attacks were. This was not the obsessively meticulous work of left-wing radical who, in fairness, could not be taken to represent the left generally. These were people who saw a fleeting window of opportunity to inflict harm on the police un-premeditated and simply took it because it was there. This is what starts to assemble the case that the homicidal hatred of the police is not a fringe view on the left, but increasingly the left-mainstream. 
2022-07-06;https://www.military.com/daily-news/2022/07/06/army-cuts-off-more-60k-unvaccinated-guard-and-reserve-soldiers-pay-and-benefits.html;authoritarianism;The National Guard has purged 40,000 soldiers, and the Reserves 22,000, for not submitting to being jabbed with an experimental mRNA immune therapy that, as of the discharge of these soldiers, is completely ineffective at preventing or lessening the severity of a case of COVID. It was already audacious enough to require soldiers to take the mRNA “vaccine” when it was rammed through the EUA process, which classifies drugs approved under its authority as experimental drugs on the market, caveat emptor. But now that a very different COVID, Omicron, makes up nearly all cases and data shows that the “vaccine” does nothing to reduce the chance of catching it, forcing troops to take the treatment is arbitrary. As data from Walgreens shows, a higher percentage of unvaccinated people tested for COVID (during the current Omicron wave) tested positive than the percentage of tested unvaccinated people testing positive—by a factor of 50% (32% vs 21%). Surely the military is not unaware of this data. In fact, it probably has even more data of its own, which is very unlikely to contradict data like Walgreens’ but reinforce it. So what could the justification for discharging these troops possibly be? The only one that comes to mind is ejecting those who will not unquestionably follow the orders of a commander-in-chief who uses vaccination as a proxy partisan sieve, and whose party is heavily invested in the companies who manufacture said “vaccine”. There could be another reason, but no convincing case has been made as to why soldiers should be discharged for not wanting to take an experimental “vaccine” which, if it ever worked, works no longer. It’s also supremely imprudent. Imagine if it were discovered later that the “vaccine” induces some extremely fatal defect into the biology of everyone who took it. If every soldier took the vaccine, our entire military would die off. But if some were unvaccinated, then if such an unlikely, but possible, scenario played out, we would not be left defenseless. Our military rose to world dominance for taking precautions like that, but if the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan didn’t prove it, our military is a far cry from its superpower-level former glory. 
2022-07-06;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7f45S6vmQgA;COVID;The UK is seeing excess deaths 15.9% higher than the 5-year average, and only 10.8% of the excess deaths reported are directly attributable to COVID. This is a terrifyingly large number of excess deaths, and COVID only explains 1 in 10 of these—this means that excess deaths specifically from COVID would only be a 1.59% excess death rate (i.e. 10% of 15.9%). So where are all these deaths coming from? And why is this not headline news in the British press? The only sudden, singular changes in medical/biological factors for mass numbers of Britons in the last 5 years have been COVID and the mRNA COVID “vaccine”. So if COVID is only responsible for 10% of the 15.9% increase, what else could account for most (though, of course, not all) of the rest of that figure but the “vaccine”? What other possible explanation can the data show? Data from countries around the world is making it increasingly difficult to escape the conclusion that the “vaccine” is far more dangerous than anyone in the government, the pharmaceutical industry, the medical profession, or the media is willing to admit. 
2022-07-08;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/08/wisconsin-supreme-court-absentee-drop-box-voting;election;The Wisconsin Supreme Court has ruled that the ballot drop boxes utilized in the state during the 2020 election are unconstitutional under the state constitution. Notably, the court did not invalidate absentee ballots, but simply clarified that voters must either mail their completed ballots or return them personally to an election official’s office (including drop boxes that official may have instituted there). This is a major blow to the legitimacy of the 2020 election in a swing state which was critical to Biden’s victory. While the Democrats are bemoaning the ruling, it should not come as a surprise to any reasonable person. How can one vouch for the integrity of ballots left in a box on some random street corner? What’s to say it hasn’t been compromised? And it is not as though this undermines absentee voting. Wisconsin residents are still free to mail their ballot by regular USPS mail or to return it in person to an election official’s office. In fact, since these are sufficient means of safely returning a ballot during a pandemic, what reason was there to provision ballot drop boxes (beyond those on state government property) in the first place? What convenience or precaution did ballot drop boxes offer beyond those that are offered by returning ballots via postal mail or to a drop box at a state government office? It seems clear that general ballot drop boxes serve to, at best, only muddy the waters in a contentious election. 
2022-07-08;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/08/news-republicans-democrats-trust-partisanship;authoritarianism;Americans’ trust in new media is at an all-time low, with only Democrats voicing strong faith in it. Is it any surprise, after an entire presidential term in which the media savaged the Republican president (deservedly and undeservedly) and backed the Democrats to the hilt, that no one but Democrats trusts the news? Since 2016, it has become clear to anyone with a shred of reasoning ability that the media, on the whole, spins any and every vaguely political news item in favor of the Democrats and against the Republicans. What is most telling is that independents seem to now see through this bias, with just over 1 in 3 trusting mass media (36%). And again, is anyone surprised? When inflation is at record highs, supplies of everything are short, and the economy is entering a recession even with businesses reopened and only Democrats to blame, why would independents trust a media which only lavishes praise on the Democrats? When 90% of Republicans and 64% of independents don’t trust the news, the conclusion that it is hopelessly biased toward the Democrats is inescapable. 
2022-07-09;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/09/army-suspends-general-tweet-mock-jill-biden;authoritarianism;A former general employed by the Defense Department has been suspended for exercising his First Amendment rights to criticize the First Lady, a clear violation of his rights. The left loves to condescendingly lecture that right that private companies have no legal obligation to preserve your First Amendment rights. This is largely true, case law is crystal clear that the government may not violate an American’s First Amendment rights—this is precisely the point of the First Amendment. This is a case in which the government is the employer, and therefor is bound by the First Amendment. Sacking military personnel over a personal slight against the nation’s leader or his family is undemocratic conduct befitting of dictators. And this is precisely the conduct that the left accused Trump of, and swore that Biden would never do because he has such high honor and integrity.  The left doesn’t get to claim that Biden and the Democrats aren’t petty, and willing to act undemocratically to act out their pettiness.
2022-07-09;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/09/shutdowndc-supreme-court-abortion-roe-protest;authoritarianism;A group of activists is offering a bounty of $250 for every sighting of a conservative Supreme Court justice, endangering their lives casually in service of the left’s political agenda. To date, the left has only heckled Supreme Court justices in public. But to essentially establish a means of constantly monitoring opposition political figures is terrifyingly authoritarian. Ostensibly, the activist organizers intend to publicize the information they obtain via the bounty so that protesters can harass the justices—what’s the point of knowing where a justice is if the activists just sit on that information, or only dispatch the group’s insiders to the justice’s location? Protests rely chiefly on numbers, and the way to marshal the largest numbers is to post a justice’s location online and invite anyone and everyone to show up and shout them down. But what is to stop a violent leftist (or any violent and disturbed individual) from using this open-source intelligence to try to kill one of the justices? There has already been one attempt on the life of a conservative justice at his home, which is significantly better-protected than some offsite location. It is much harder to secure a location like a restaurant or store which a security team or its client does not own and control than the client’s home (which the client would open fully to the security detail to fortify). Thus, the activists are offering more viable opportunities to would-be assassins than they previously had trying to breach assail a justice at their home. And, like with all left-wing authoritarianism, it becomes clear for what it is when one considers the hypothetical reverse: imagine if even the most moderately right-leaning activists paid for intel on the location of left-leaning Supreme Court justices? The Democrats, the media, and celebrities would all condemn it as fascist, and the FBI would round up the activists within the week. But when the right is the target, it is merely shrugged off. This is what makes the left the true authoritarians and fascists. They believe they have the right to subject their enemies to any amount of physical danger, or inflict any amount of financial and/or reputational ruin, to pursue their agenda, but will tolerate not even the faintest peaceful rhetorical dissent from their enemies. Moreover, the left will gladly rely on radical street enforcers to intimidate and destroy their enemies. What else explains how it is that Antifa could literally seize and occupy portions of American cities, explicitly stating that they had wrested control away from the democratically elected city government, and not be aggressively arrested and prosecuted by law enforcement? Again, if a right-wing extremist group took over part of a city, they would be immediately branded as terrorists and opposed with the full force of the state—and RIGHTLY so in that case. This hounding and casual jeopardization of the conservative justices will not be the last or most brazen authoritarian act by the left. Rather, if not opposed by a strong and even-handed application of the law of our land, the left will gradually push the envelope until the nation either submits to them utterly or until the left’s vigilante shock troops gain de facto control of the streets of every major American city. 
2022-07-11;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/11/biden-2024-democratic-voters;election;The majority of Democrat voters would prefer a candidate other than Biden to run for president in 2024, showing an extraordinary lack of faith in a sitting president by one’s own party. In the last 50 years, a sitting president has never lost a presidential primary election while running for a second term. In that same time period, a first-term president has also not declined to run for a second term. Should Biden remove himself from the 2024 race, or be defeated in the primary, it would mark a huge blow to the Democrats by underscoring what a colossal mistake it was to nominate Biden in the first place. In other words, Biden’s performance is clearly spectacularly bad if his own party voters strongly contemplating abandoning him such as has not happened to a president in almost 3 generations. 
2022-07-12;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62130595;identity;In remarking on the diversity of American Latinos, Jill Biden compared them to “breakfast tacos”. For the party that claims to be such ardent opponents of racism, Democrats and their spouses sure do say a lot of racially insensitive (if not outright racist) things. How is it not obvious to any rational adult that reducing an ethnic group to their cuisine is racially offensive? How is that Jill Biden could have failed this extremely simple exercise in critical thought (or, really, common sense)? Someone deeply committed to racial progress should have not even the slightest chance of making such a glaring error. 
2022-07-13;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/13/june-cpi-report-inflation-fed-biden;economy;Inflation only continues to rise, hitting 9.1% officially. The fact that it continues to rise instead of leveling off shows that whatever Biden is doing in terms of economic policy isn’t working. When are Americans going to realize that Biden and his party don’t know what they’re doing, at least on the economy, if not in many policy areas? And more importantly, how long until Democrats and their zealous supporters stop making excuses as to why inflation and all his other policy failures aren’t his fault, and admit they made a grave error in electing Biden? 
2022-07-13;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/13/democrats-biden-white-college-graduates-poll;identity;As hard as it insists that it stands for the average American, the Democratic Party has cemented itself as the party of the elite, as polling now convincingly shows. A new poll shows that Democrats lead the Republicans by 20 points in the demographic of white college graduates. Additionally, Latino voters are now evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. If Republicans were truly so racist, shouldn’t the Democrats lead the Latino demographic by a massive margin? It should not have taken this poll to illustrate how elite the Democrats are. All one needs to do is pull the FEC filings (which are publicly available) for campaign donations to see how the overwhelming majority of donations by top IT workers (over 90%), academics/educators, celebrities, and billionaires go to Democrats. The Democrats are the party of bankers, venture capitalists, highly skilled tech workers, academia, and Hollywood—i.e. the groups of people with the most disdain and contempt for the average American, profiting greatly at their expense. This drives the Democrats’ entire worldview, in which they govern as though their “inferiors” don’t exist. This is why Democrats and their supporters dismiss inflation as simply “things costing more”, rather than for the hard choices and financial squeeze on working families. This is why it took weeks for Democrats to respond to the critical shortage of baby formula. This is why Democrats respond to the fuel crunch by blithely advocating that everyone buy an electric car, as though every American can just afford a new vehicle from a class of vehicle that is more expensive (and as though that would not radically drive up the waste of perfectly functioning gas-powered vehicles). These are only a handful of examples, but they paint a larger picture of Democrats are out-of-touch elites who have the audacity to tell working Americans how to live their lives. 
2022-07-13;https://www.theregister.com/2022/07/13/supremes_doxed_post_roe/;authoritarianism;A tech media outlet has discovered the presence of Supreme Court justices’ sensitive personal data in data breaches, which almost certainly means that those who with motivation and malicious ideological intent have already obtained it. If a news outlet, which divides its time and effort among many stories and leads, was able to find personally identifying information on Supreme Court justices, then a motivated individual whose intent is singularly focused on inflicting malicious harm on Supreme Court justices would have easily done so before now. Granted, such an individual does not necessarily have an ideological bent. But at this point, with Roe v. Wade overturned, of those who have malicious intent toward the justices, the majority would be aligned with the left. What reason does the right have to wish harm on justices who did as they’ve hoped for decades?
2022-07-13;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/14/ice-immigration-spending-border-budget;immigration;ICE under Biden is undertaking so much immigration enforcement that it is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and on track to spend more than it ever has. If Biden was truly as merciful in regards to deporting illegal immigrants, how does Biden explain his record expenditures on immigration enforcement? This is yet another data point making the case that the Democrats stand for nothing, and will say whatever it is their voters want to hear even when they don’t have the faintest intention of living up to their word. 
2022-07-15;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/07/15/violent-crime-the-top-health-concern-for-surveyed-south-siders-uchicago-study-finds/;law enforcement;While rich entitled Democrats and their supporters obsess over police brutality, those in Chicago’s poorest neighborhoods are primarily concerned with the significantly more prevalent street violence that plagues their neighborhoods, and which those Democrats do nothing to counter. Excessive use of force by police officers is a real issue, to be sure. However, far more people are killed by (sadly) commonplace gang and domestic violence, particularly in poor neighborhoods (often with a high concentration of racial minorities)—this is so by at least 2 orders of magnitude. The victims of this violence know this intimately well. And yet as much as the Democrats claim to stand up for racial minorities, they do nothing to stop the killings that play out in racial minority communities every day even as those communities beg for their leaders to do just that. This shows just how little the Democrats care about the people they claim to champion the most. Far from being racially progressive, it is hard to imagine anything more racist than using racial minorities as an instrument gaining political power. Democrats make empty promises to stand up for racial minority groups, fixate on a comparatively niche issue affecting those groups, and do nothing to address the biggest threat to those groups.
2022-07-15;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/07/15/wear-masks-indoors-get-vaccinated-and-tested-as-covid-ba-5-spreads-county-health-officials-say/;COVID;Democrat elected officials and their subservient bureaucrats continue to insist on the efficacy of the COVID mRNA “vaccine”, going so far as to advocate its use explicitly against the latest COVID variant, despite ample data showing its inefficacy. As the BA.5 subvariant of the Omicron variant comes to prominence, Democrat-appointed health officials have reiterated their calls to take the COVID “vaccine”. Recall that the pharmaceutical companies that produced the previous “vaccines” are working on retooling it to the mRNA material associated with Omicron. This is logic a 9-year-old could work out. If the current vaccine is effective against Omicron, why would the drug manufacturers be working on a new vaccine for it? Ergo, that means even the drug companies think the vaccine doesn’t work (at least against Omicron and its descendants). So if that is the case, how does it make any sense for public health officials to urge use of the old vaccine which the new formula is intended to replace? Either these officials are stupid, or they think the public is, neither of which should inspire confidence. How does anyone have faith in the Democrats or their loyal servants in the bureaucracy? 
2022-07-17;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/17/monkeypox-scott-gottlieb-contain;public health;A former FDA official’s assessment of Biden’s handling of the monkeypox epidemic is of total failure. Biden’s campaign was, in large part, based on a promise to confront the COVID pandemic with competence. Indeed, Biden has taken credit for supposedly “ending” the pandemic despite the fact that COVID still circulates and the mRNA “vaccines” offer no protection against the current strain. And yet despite the monkeypox epidemic following so closely on the heels of COVID that it should be trivial to implement lessons learned, Biden’s administration has allowed monkeypox to circulate practically unchecked, to the point where the spread is out of control. How is it that the Democrats can continue to claim that THEY are the most responsible stewards of public health when they can’t contain an epidemic right after they got a crash course in how to handle a pandemic?
2022-07-17;https://twitter.com/DefiantLs/status/1548725724823126019;authoritarianism;A left-darling “journalist” condemned Trump for maintaining open diplomatic discourse with dictators, as has long been the policy of the US, but gave Biden a pass for playing nice with the despots of the world. Whether you agree that the US should be friendly with dictators is irrelevant. What matters is that the double-standard that the professedly neutral media advances always favors the left. The right gets savaged for dealing with dictators to secure US interests, while the left is absolved for doing the same because it’s just “how the game is played”. Does no one find it alarming that the media which Americans rely on to inform them sufficiently to perform their electoral duties decides to always demonize one side and always angelic-ize the other? How is this not the trappings of a one-party state? The media in China only lauds the Communist Party. The media in America only lauds the Democratic Party (as a PARTY, though the media may scrutinize individual Democrats on rare occasions). What substantive difference is there between these two nations’ government-media dynamics? 
2022-07-18;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/18/greenwood-park-mall-shooting-indiana-multiple-dead;crime;As Democrats are poised to restrict gun rights to make up for the failings of individual law enforcement bodies, a responsible armed citizen saves dozens of lives by shooting and killing an active shooter in a crowded mall. Criminals will always find a way to obtain weapons, and any criminal intent on obtaining a weapon has no compunctions killing (and vice versa). Tightening gun laws, therefore, does nothing to meaningfully impede criminals from obtaining and using guns. In the last few mass shootings, reg flag laws that are already on the books could have prevented the assailants from getting guns, but simply were not enforced. All stricter gun laws would do is prevent law-abiding citizens like the young man in Greenwood from being able to oppose violent criminals dead-set on obtaining deadly weapons for taking innocent lives. There are already few responsible armed citizens willing to face the legal repercussions of using their weapons to protect innocent life, legal repercussions imposed on them by anti-gun Democrats hell-bent on preventing anyone from wielding a gun for any reason, even if that reason is defense of the innocent.
2022-07-19;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/18/anthony-fauci-retirement-biden-term;COVID;Fauci has announced that he will be retiring before the end of Biden’s term, timing that conveniently spares him from facing any accountability under any potential future Republican presidents. Of course, it’s possible that Fauci was planning to retire around that time before the pandemic, or when the pandemic hit but stayed on longer than he intended to steward the country through it. However, going into the pandemic Fauci was already past the traditional retirement age, so he clearly had no problem with working late into his life. So why, then, does he want to throw in the towel? In fact, shouldn’t he stay through to any subsequent administration to ensure that the right lessons from COVID are learned and acted upon? It sure does look as if he’s trying to get out of NIH before he faces the consequences for his disastrous handling of the pandemic, and the attempts by his agency (and those below it) to impose draconian “public health” restrictions on American’s freedoms far beyond the scope of their authority. His imminent retirement simply does not seem like the actions of someone who can easily defend his actions during the most substantial challenge a bureaucrat holding his position has ever faced. 
2022-07-20;https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus/country/new-zealand;COVID;Data from New Zealand (provided by Johns Hopkins) shows not only that the mRNA COVID “vaccine” is ineffective, but that there is an inverse relationship between vaccination rates and COVID case rates—and COVID death rates. New Zealand reached nearly 75% full vaccination by December 21, 2021. But despite this, by April 2, 2022 the new daily confirmed COVID deaths in New Zealand spiked to 19 TIMES the highest daily COVID death rate EVER recorded before the nation’s populace hit the 75% vaccination mark. Deaths have soared even higher, with new daily COVID deaths in New Zealand as of July 20, 2022 reaching 22 times their pre-COVID vaccine peak. The rate of new daily COVID cases in New Zealand is consistent with this stunning data on COVID deaths. Before the 75% vaccination mark on December 21, 2021, the highest daily case rate for COVID in New Zealand was just under 200 cases per day. By March of 2022, it was over 15,00 new cases per day, and is currently (as of July 20, 2022) over 8000 new cases per day. If the vaccine was so effective, this shouldn’t be possible, even when correcting for the fact that the dominant COVID strains are more infectious. It is now all but impossible to escape the conclusion that the COVID “vaccine” is utterly useless. 
2022-07-21;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-21/biden-is-positive-for-covid-has-mild-symptoms-white-house-says;COVID;With Biden’s COVID diagnosis comes yet another instance of an mRNA “vaccine” apologist catching COVID. Not only does he continue to defend the mRNA jab to the hilt, but he has never backed down from insisting that everyone take the “vaccine”. Nor has Biden ever apologized or publicly reversed his support for the COVID “vaccine” mandates which deprived American of their freedom to bodily autonomy—an autonomy which he so ardently claims to believe in now that the Supreme Court has overturned Roe v. Wade. So Biden sang the praises of the mRNA shot at every turn, took it himself, and even attempted to wield coercive legal authority to make the vast majority of American adults take it, only to himself contract COVID. He has not yet emerged from his treatment, but now that he has become living proof of the staggering failure of the COVID mRNA immune therapy, once he has recovered, he owes an apology to every American for ever backing forced medical treatment.
2022-07-22;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/22/gop-rep-zeldin-attacked-new-york-governor-campaign-event;authoritarianism;An individual attempted to stab a Republican gubernatorial candidate in Democrat-dominated New York State. As always, with attacks like this, there is not always a political motive, but merely an intent by an unstable individual to kill someone in the public eye to gain notoriety. However, the intended target was not widely known on the national stage, so such a motive seems unlikely. Rather, it is more likely that the attack stems from anger at the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, anger which flares up most aggressively in leftist strongholds like coastal states. Assuming there IS a political dimension (granted, an assumption, but one which seems more plausible than the alternative assumption), there is only one end of the political spectrum the assailant could be aligned with: the left. Why would the right attempt to murder one of their own? Some leftist apologist may argue that there is a far-right faction which believes mainstream Republicans to be too moderate, but even so, wouldn’t such a far-right still find the left more intolerable than the center-right? This is yet another piece of evidence challenging the narrative that political violence comes only from the right. Not only does it most certainly come from the left, but MORE frequently from the left than the right. 
2022-07-24;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/24/mark-milley-china-military-aggression;foreign policy;US generals are now warning that China’s military is showing signs of being “noticeably more aggressive”. There are only two reasons why this dynamic would play out. One is that China is responding to US aggression, and the other is that China smells America’s weakness. The US has not been particularly aggressive toward China since Biden assumed office, so it is almost certainly that China is slowly positioning itself for military action. Taiwan would seem the logical target, but regardless, China clearly feels uninhibited enough that it is not worried about a US response to increasing its military activity. This reflects weakness, and that comes from the very top: the Biden administration. This is evidenced by the fact that China’s outward aggression was not as pronounced under Trump as it is under Biden (or was under Obama). Yet again, the Democrats make assurances about their competence at administering the affairs of our nation that they are simply not equipped to keep. 
2022-07-25;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/25/biden-recession-economy-gdp-growth;economy;Biden is denying that the country will be in the recession that it is already in. The US has already met the conditions which traditionally define a recession, on top of months of record levels of inflation. And yet Biden is pretending like the nation can still avert recession. The Democrats constantly accused Trump of gaslighting the American people, so how is this not the same thing? To the left, the Democrats are allowed to spin anything to defend their actions or distract from their disastrous handling of the country.
2022-07-26;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62308455;public health;The CDC has admitted that there are more monkyepox cases in the US than anywhere else in the world. Certainly, the US has one of the largest populations in the world, so this is a contributing factor—there will be more cases where there are more people. But at the same time, the US has one of the most advanced healthcare systems in the world. More importantly, Biden swore he would expertly handle COVID, and should therefore have no problem controlling an epidemic of a less transmissible disease. And yet the Biden administration has utterly failed to contain monkeypox by any measure. 
2022-07-28;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-62310355;economy;The hard facts and data on the US economy continue to challenge Biden’s narrative that the economy is fine, this time with data showing further contraction of GDP. How audacious is it that the Biden administration is continuing to deny that the economy is in recession? When will Biden own up to his failings and deal with the American people honestly? After all, as the Democrats tell it, Trump was the liar, and Biden is an honorable man who tells the truth. He sure isn’t acting like it. 
2022-07-28;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/28/sf-ny-declare-health-emergencies-monkeypox-outbreak;public health;San Francisco and New York City have declared a public health emergency due to overwhelming monkeypox case numbers, showing once again that Democrats are unequipped to handle epidemics as they insisted for the past 2 years. Again, in fairness, large population centers will see more spread than small ones, so SF and NY are at natural disadvantages. But again, these Democrats stronghold cities were fresh off a pandemic—in fact, in these cities continue to implement some (though not all) of the COVID public health controls. So if these Democrat-devised public health policies, which are ongoing, are so effective, how come they can’t stop a disease that isn’t even airborne (as COVID was)? 
2022-07-29;https://www.axios.com/2022/07/29/stagflation-economy-inflation;economy;With an incipient recession and high inflation, America is at risk of stagflation, an economic state of affairs most economists consider to be the worst possible outcome (short of depression). Stagflation is exactly the combination of economic stagnation (i.e. recession) and inflation. America has both. It is not a foregone conclusion that this will result in stagflation, but the conditions are present. America has not experienced stagflation since the 1970s. How can the Democrats continue to claim to be such great stewards of the economy when they are single-handedly driving the nation toward the most direst economic straits in decades? 
2022-07-28;https://youtu.be/h_o6cuuzRZ0;authoritarianism;The latest iteration of YouTube censorship comes to the aid of radical leftists by banning not a slur, but a useful and neutral term used to classify a child abuser. YouTube now no longer allows its users to use the term “groomer” just as the term was taking off and being used to describe radical leftists who use their access to children (notably in education) to push age-inappropriate discussions of sexuality with minors. In the interest of fairness, it must be admitted that there is a painful history in which those prejudiced against LGBT individuals used the term “groomer” to imply all LGBT people abuse children—an accusation which is obviously far from true. However, this phenomenon long predates this censorship update. If YouTube always found “groomer” to be a hateful anti-gay slur, then why hasn’t it always been banned (as in the case of the n-word)? What is more likely, that YouTube content moderators only JUST discovered that “groomer” is offensive to all LGBT people, or that they are trying to provide cover for radical leftists now that they are taking significant fire from conservative and independent critics? Also unlike the n-word, which has no non-offensive context, the word “groomer” has a de facto technical meaning which is not derogatory toward LGBT people: any individual who psychologically manipulates a child to make that child vulnerable to abuse (especially sexual abuse). YouTube’s latest censorship is NOT to remove the homophobic use of “groomer” but allow its technical use. Rather, YouTube is proscribing ALL use of “groomer”. Given the circumstances of this new ban, how is this anything other than politically motivated? And of course, YouTube would never ban a term used to vilify the right. That’s why YouTube is perfectly fine with people using words like “Nazi” and “fascist” against anyone for any reason (as long as the target isn’t on the left). The double-standard of censorship remains hard at work, and more audacious than ever.

This is a completely reasonable and intuitive thing to believe, and yet the left has insisted that only the right buys into conspiracy theories. This claim is not only contradicted by this new study, but by empirical evidence over the last few years. What was the Trump-Russia collusion theory if not a conspiracy theory? For years, a special prosecutor with sweeping investigatory and subpoena powers searched high and low for collusion but couldn’t find any. On the contrary, the FBI did find that the the Steele dossier, which was used as a pretext to authorize surveillance against Trump, was fabricated and that the FBI knew this at the time they reviewed it apropos of authorizing surveillance on Trump. A huge segment of Democrats also believe that Russia changed vote totals in the 2016 via cyber operations even though there is absolutely zero evidence that this was the case. How is that not a conspiracy theory? The reason that the Democrats deny that they fall for conspiracy theories is that they seek to delegitimize their opponents and justify the use of state power to suppress them. The supposed danger of supposedly rampant right-wing conspiracy theories was exactly the pretext for the disinformation board that Biden attempted to form under Homeland Security, which would have acted as a government censorship organ. So it is not mere political posturing: it is vital to Democrat political censorship and repression efforts that they convince Americans that the Democrats believe only the absolute objective truth. 
2022-08-04;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-declare-monkeypox-public-health-emergency-washington-post-2022-08-04/;public health;The US has officially declared a nationwide public health emergency over monkeypox, acknowledging Biden’s catastrophic failure to contain a contagion despite boasting of his prowess in doing so where Trump supposedly failed. The Biden administration (and Democrats generally) have no business claiming they are so adept at executing public health policy when they couldn’t respond to an epidemic (monkeypox) even with lessons freshly obtained from a global pandemic (COVID). 
2022-08-08;https://www.axios.com/2022/08/08/police-department-staff-shortage;law enforcement;Cities around the country can’t hire enough police officers to meet their staffing levels. A 9-year-old could easily explain to you that the reason people are especially uninterested in becoming police officers is because the swaths of outwardly leftist urban inhabitants routinely state that “all cops are bastards”. Yes, law enforcement has always struggled to attract employees because of the long hours, low pay, and elevated danger inherent in the profession. But that has always been the case, and would not suddenly have an increased effect on recruitment. The one variable that IS different is public perception. Specifically, one very vocal minority of the public vociferously believes that all law enforcement should be disbanded. This in itself is immaterial, but these same people are the ones who call for officers to get prosecuted every time they use force in the line of duty, whether justifiably so or not. Why would anyone want to be a police officer if they are going to get arrested any time they use a weapon to protect themselves or the public? The same 9-year-old could also tell you what the effect of this law enforcement staffing shortage will be: higher crime. And yet the average leftist seems stunned that their neighborhoods are seeing elevated crime rates. Even leftists, one would imagine, do not want violence inflicted upon them (they are, of course, OK with perpetrating violence, as evidenced by Antifa operating completely unopposed in the Pacific Northwest). And yet their zealotry is stifling the recruitment of exactly the people best able to reduce that violence. They claim that “restorative justice” reduces crime, but there is no data on the scale of a major American city to back this up. Ask the 9-year-old a third time and they will corroborate this with intuition. What is more likely to reduce recidivism, making a criminal “restore” the harm they caused (essentially just apologize) and nothing more, or being locked behind bars for years? If that 9-year-old hit another kid on the playground, they’d be less likely to do it if they had a timeout than if they had to just say “sorry”. Funny enough, leftists seem to agree that the “restorative justice” they advocate doesn’t work, when judged by their actions. When a liberal prosecutor or DA assumes office, they don’t practice “restorative justice” but simply stop enforcing laws against theft, property damage, and certain kinds of use of a weapon. This, too, has had the result the 9-year-old could guess: rising rates of crime overall. Somehow our society has decided to let these radical deologue leftists, who don’t understand what the 9-year-old can reason out, call the shots.
2022-08-08;https://www.axios.com/2022/08/08/donald-trump-home-raided-fbi;authoritarianism;The FBI under Democrat Biden raided the home of his political opponent, Trump, on arbitrary and inapplicable charges, the behavior of failed state tyrants. These are the same Democrats who screamed throughout the 2016 election that it is undemocratic and un-American to “jail political opponents”. And yet why would the FBI raid Trump’s home unless they intended to put him in jail? Once again, on a matter they claim to hold in the highest respect, the sacred defense of democracy, the Democrats have determined they deserve to enjoy a double-standard. Democratic norms are for Democrats, Republicans deserve no fair treatment. But the naked authoritarianism of the Democrats gets even more glaring. Let’s take the argument that they rejected when Trump made it about Clinton but which they now embrace against Trump: what if a highly placed political figure DID actually commit a crime? If we want to prosecute highly placed politicians, then, let’s look at the score. What is Trump now accused of (informally, as there have been no charges publicly released in connection with this raid)? Supposedly, it I that he removed intelligence from the White House improperly. However, he was still president when he did so, and by law, the president is an origin of classification, meaning he is allowed to declassify any piece of intelligence merely by doing so. By definition, his removal of these items from a classified environment while president makes them declassified under the law. You can dislike the law, but the law remains the law. By contrast, when Clinton maintained a State Department email server in her private residence, she broke the law. This is because the Secretary of State does not have the same classification authority as the president. What Clinton did is indisputably a crime, and far more dangerous to national security. Trump supposedly removed some paper documents, whereas Clinton housed all her State Department emails in her private residence, ON THE INTERNET, where any nation-state cyber actor could (and probably did) steal them. In that light, it makes a lot more sense how China has bested the US at every turn from Clinton’s tenure as Secretary of State up through now. So if we want to get fair about locking politicians up (IF), the Democrats should start with Clinton. The only other thing the Democrats supposedly have Trump on that could possibly justify this raid is his First Amendment-protected political speech—which the Supreme Court has long ruled has NO legal limit whatsoever—on January 6, 2021. With those ruled out, the only likely alternatives are that Biden sicked the FBI on Trump to keep him out of the 2024 presidential race by (a) intimidating him out of running or (b) going all the way and imprisoning Trump. This action by Biden is as anti-democratic as it gets. The first simply won’t happen. And if the second played out, it would trigger civil unrest the likes of which Americans could never dream up in their worst nightmares. That’s not my desire—I want peace—that’s just what any rational person would tell you would happen as a result. If Americans who cherish their civil liberties take a stand and oppose this with an overwhelming Democrat defeat at the ballot box, this will be the single stupidest political move they could have ever made (the stupidest of all time). If not, then America has lurched down the path to tyranny from which it will never recover. 
2022-08-09;https://youtu.be/quxl0gb1eBE;COVID;More evidence has emerged showing that mRNA COVID “vaccine” manufacturers misled the public on the rigor of their testing and outright lied about the drug’s effectiveness. Scrutinizing claims by the mRNA jab manufacturers, insisting that they tested it on animals, reveals that they conducted animal testing and human testing simultaneously. The whole point of animal testing is to do so BEFORE human testing so that as much foreseeable harm to humans test subjects can be avoided as possible. So while it’s technically true that animal testing took place, the fact that it was concurrent with human testing is so utterly against the spirit of animal testing that they may as well have not bothered with animal testing at all. In the case of the AstraZeneca jab, it was tested on the laughably small number of 20 macaques, only 6 of which received an actual dose (rather than a placebo). In other words, it sure seems as though they tested on animals just to tick a regulatory box and satisfy skepticism from a casual line of questioning. More importantly, these details also illustrate that these pharma titans knew limitations of their drugs’ effectiveness and hid it from the public anyway. The animal study with the 20 macaques saw all 20 catch COVID… meaning that the “vaccine” did not stop the spread. The mRNA jab never stopped the spread at any point, and the drug companies knew this. Moreover, this was evident in their data, which they provided to the FDA, which means that the government ALSO knew this all along. And yet both the drug companies and the government lied, stating that the “vaccines” stopped the spread. The governments of many states and cities went so far as to impose “vaccine” mandates, with even Biden’s federal government attempting the same via OSHA. What kind of government of a free country is it that can claim it respects individual freedoms and then not only removing Americans’ medical autonomy, but do so on a pretext they know to be false? How can any government claim to respect freedom when it took away its citizens’ medical freedom on a lie, to “stop the spread” when it knew the drug they forced on American was incapable of stopping the spread?
2022-08-12;https://dailyclout.io/pfizer-misleadingly-classified-multiple-miscarriages/;COVID;There is an alarmingly strong correlation between the Pfizer mRNA COVID “vaccine” and miscarriages in pregnant women. Throughout the pandemic, pregnant women as a group have been among the most skeptical of the mRNA COVID immune therapy shots pushed by pharmaceutical giants and the government (namely Democrats). It seems they had good reason for this. Analysis of Pfizer trial data shows anywhere from 18% to 44% of pregnant women in their test data suffering a miscarriage. This compares with a miscarriage rate of around 1 in 4 normally for American women. How is this not cause for concern among medical professionals? In the past, if a drug coincided with this high of a rate of miscarriages, the FDA would immediately suspend its licensure, and possibly even pursue criminal prosecution or the manufacturers. Yet somehow, the government appears nonplussed by this data.  
2022-08-17;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ztGWBis18k;authoritarianism;The Democrats, who have claimed the mantle of guardians of democracy, have used their dominance in one blue state to shut third-parties out of the gubernatorial ballot. In New York state, Democrats snuck provisions into a budget bill to precipitously increase the number of signatures required for a candidate to be allowed onto a state ballot. The threshold was raised so high so quickly that for the first time in nearly a century, there will be no third-party candidate on the ballot for New York governor. There is no other reason to raise the number of required signatures other than to try to keep certain candidates from running. And the Democrats better not dare claim the move was about election integrity or security, because they’ve spent the last 2 years not only insisting that the 2020 election was the most secure election of all time (so how could heightened security possibly be necessary?), but decrying any attempt to impose a verification process on voters (such as requiring an ID, as is typical in even the most leftist European countries) as racist. Moreover, if it were for election security, why hide it away in a budget bill where no one would find it? Why not proclaim it proudly as yet another step toward ensuring election integrity? The Democrats have no claim to the be party of democracy if they are intentionally shoving challengers off the ballot. In fact, few things are more authoritarian than manipulating election rules to exclude candidates from the electoral process. This is what tyrants like Putin do. How are the Democrats any different when it comes to elections? 
2022-08-25;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62664181;economy;The Democrats continue to bail out their political devotees and reward all the wrong personal, financial, and economic decisions by forgiving $10,000 of student debt to every student. This move is abysmally bad for a whole host of reasons. First, it punishes all the students who worked to put themselves through school. What do Biden and the Democrats have to say to these students who could have taken out a loan that would just be forgiven who instead traded years of sleep and seeing their friends and family to work to pay for school? This policy is of minimal help to the working poor that the Democrats claim were the intended recipients, but instead immensely buoys the upper-middle class (mostly white) suburbanites that make up the base of their party, and who don’t need it the decreased debt burden. Second, this measure rewards students for getting degrees that are of little to no utility in the modern US economy. If these students had obtained degrees in high-paying fields—high-paying because the economy has deemed these jobs of greater benefit to overall economic growth—they would not need loan forgiveness because they would have gotten a job that pays down their debt. All this does is signal to Millennial and Gen Z Democrat cultists that they should feel uninhibited to pursue degrees in Gender Studies, Theater, and the like, resulting in Americans who generate no economic value. Third, this will actually result in reduced access to higher education for young Americans. Just like with health care (i.e. Obamacare), the Democrats are either too self-interested or too inept to actually reduce the cost of the product or service being obtained, instead dispensing a one-time treatment to the symptom. Bankers aren’t stupid. Now that they know that the student loans they dispense can just evaporate at any moment, they’ll just give out fewer loans. Biden apologists may counter that this just means that university tuition will have to respond to decreased loan availability by dropping prices. Maybe, but American universities are already so highly coveted that they’re more likely to keep their prices high and just admit more foreign students. If a university already has to turn away the majority of applicants then what reason is there to lower their tuition? And if the number of American students who can afford tuition declines, there is a nearly inexhaustible supply of wealthy foreign students who will gladly take their place. Biden’s loan cancellation will truly have the effect of shifting American universities to becoming social clubs for the progeny of the global elite. Finally, by handing out what amounts to free money, the Democrats are back to buy votes, this time to college students. To be more accurate, this move is about generating new votes. It is already well-established that American universities are essentially leftist indoctrination operations beneath a thin veil of an educational institution. If the Democrats signal that young Americans’ “education” at these establishments will be free, the university system will absorb more young Americans and churn out more leftist converts. This will catalyze the presently ongoing operation to create generation after generation of zealous, sheepish Democrat voters. This may be one round of loan forgiveness for students who have already graduated, but the trend line on in mainstream left US politics is to give more and more handouts to more and more groups. Viewed rationally from all angles, all this policy does is set our economy up for long-term decline and generate more voters for the Democrats.
2022-08-26;https://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2022/8/26/biden-asks-democrats-to-defeat-semi-fascism-in-midterm-election;authoritarianism;The Democrats are practicing more psychological projection by labeling Republicans as “semi-fascist”. The Democrats have the audacity to call Republicans fascists when the Democrats are the ones who police what Americans can and can’t say (in coordination with their corporate masters in Big Tech), the ones who hides the truth (again, via Big Tech) that harms their electoral standing, the ones who destroyed small businesses with years of forced closures and transferred more wealth to the elites than ever before in world history, the ones who let their street enforcers in Anitfa and the violent fringe of BLM to burn and beat with impunity, and the ones who used every coercive instrument in their power in the public and private sector to force Americans to take an ineffective experimental mRNA immunotherapy to combat a disease with a minuscule fatality rate (outside of a small number of certain high-risk groups). Meanwhile, the supposedly divisive Republican party is building up more support with racial minorities, women, and the middle and lower class than ever before, as evidenced by Trump’s increased share of votes from all of these groups from 2016 to 2020. Republicans didn’t censor speech in the 4 years Trump was president, allowing the left to throw as many tantrums as they wanted. The Republicans didn’t impose ineffectual stay-at-home orders that laid waste to American small businesses, the lifeblood of the economy. The Republicans never forced anyone to take a drug against their will, holding their livelihood hostage to do so. The main argument that Democrats trot out to ascribe fascism to the Republicans is the January 6 Riot. But this sad episode was far from an insurrection, as the rioters did not kill a single civil servant or agent of the state when it was easily within their power to do so on numbers alone (to say nothing of the weapons they could have brought to bear). January 6 was a shameful riot for which all participants who broke the law should be prosecuted. But it was no coup: it was overwhelmingly unarmed, aimless, directionless, and unmotivated. On the other hand, the Democrats led the charge in changing election law by executive pen in states across the country, in violation of state law and the constitution. Did this change the outcome of the election? It’s extremely difficult to know at this point. But what is certain is that election law was knowingly disregarded, which casts doubt on the outcome. So when we look at the whole score, who are the real fascists? 
2022-08-26;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-62688532;authoritarianism;Zuckerberg admits that the FBI after a fashion told Facebook to censor stories that were critical of Biden. In an interview with Rogan, Zukerberg stated that although the FBI did not instruct Facebook to censor the Hunter Biden laptop story specifically, the FBI warned that a damaging piece of “disinformation” was going to be imminently released. Why would the FBI warn Facebook about disinformation if it did not intend for Facebook to censor it? It is doubtful that the FBI issues warnings like this for no reason, just to keep social media platforms informed and leave them to respond as they choose. The tacit understanding is that Facebook was to suppress whatever this “disinformation” was. And how fortunate for Biden that the Hunter Biden laptop story emerged after the FBI implied that Facebook should censor stories. And to those Democrat apologists who insist that the FBI is guarding against ALL forms of disinformation, does any thinking person actually believe for a moment that the FBI would have advised or assisted in suppressing disinformation that harms Trump? The whole notion that Trump colluded with Russia in 2016 is, in fact, disinformation, in that it is not supported by any substantial factual evidence. This is the clearest case yet of the government entities with a left slant using their power to influence the election. If this played out in any other nation, Americans would rightly regard this as a sign of corruption. But in America, the left doesn’t care if the government interferes in an election as long as their side benefits. What is more anti-democratic than that? 
2022-08-28;https://quillette.com/2022/08/28/the-fall-of-nature/;authoritarianism;Leftists at the highest levels of the scientific community are now openly declaring that they won’t publish studies that contradict the left’s political agenda. The supposedly pro-science left has now decreed that they will not publish any research which could be taken to imply and differences in ability or outcome between different social groups. This is just patently absurd, not only because some groups very plainly enjoy different outcomes than others, but because the cause of equality they profess to support must understand these realities to have any chance to ensuring the fair outcomes they preach. How can a political movement that wants fairness not want to understand how outcomes are distributed? The journal in question, Nature, did state that it sought to study unequal outcomes that it deems to be caused by discrimination, but nothing else—it will not consider cultural, genetic, neurological, or sexual dimorphic differences as causes of unequal outcomes. As the Quillette critique’s author points out, this leftist virtue signaling paean would strike studies which establish the biological reality that the average adult (XY chromosome-having) male is stronger that the average adult (XX chromosome-having) female. The author also astutely notes that the left would not have tolerated this open declaration of censorship had the shoe been on the other foot, and the journal had vowed to censor anything that doesn’t adhere to the conservative moral worldview. Moreover, if it is empirically evident that social groups are equal, then why are they so concerned about censoring studies to the contrary? If there’s proof that everyone is equal, shouldn’t the left be able to be confident that the science is on their side and that the evidence can defeat counter-claims? But the outcomes that groups enjoy IS sometimes determined by differences in culture, genetics, neurochemistry, and sex. This is an objective fact. The nature and distribution of these varied outcomes as they relate to culture, genetics, neurochemistry, and sex are yet to be fully understood. It has traditionally been science’s task to understand them. The left has declared that, as long as it has control of the scientific establishment, it has no interest in discovering these differences. How is what the American/Western left doing in the journal Nature different from the Nazi pseudoscientific establishment warping science to reinforce its agenda? 
2022-08-29;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mWszGWrLZE;COVID;New data released by the American Heart Association reveals that men under 40 are at a higher risk of myocarditis from the COVID mRNA “vaccines” than from a case of COVID itself. This is another nail in the coffin for the claim that the mRNA immune therapy shots for COVID are safe. It somehow wasn’t convincing enough that reports to the VAERS database were at an all-time high. Now enough data has been released that the case is self-evidently made that these shots are not as safe as advertised. The real science shows that people have every reason to be hesitant about taking the shots, and to make their own choice for their own body. That the government acts as though it did not have data indicating this much risk shows either that it is supremely incompetent, or supremely corrupt. At th barest of bare minimums, the Biden administration and every state and city administration that imposed “vaccine” mandates owes their citizens an apology for forcing this dangerous treatment on them. It is inescapable now how misguided this attempted (and, in some cases, successful) coercion was, and how dubious the benefit of the mRNA treatment is. 
2022-08-30;https://www.axios.com/2022/08/30/california-covid-misinformation-bill-doctors;authoritarianism;California lawmakers are working to pass a law that would criminalize the dissemination of “medical disinformation”, ensuring that the public health bureaucrats get to mandate what medical treatments you may, may not, or must take. Any attempt by the government to criminalize certain forms of speech should be viewed with extreme skepticism at the very least. But given the radical shifts in public health guidance throughout the course of the pandemic, not to mention the glaring contradictions between public health pronouncements and the data-driven real science, this attempt at speech control should be viewed as utterly suspect. Recall that in the roughly 2 years of the pandemic public health officials have flip-flopped on the efficacy of masks, the transmissibility of COVID between vaccinated individuals, and the origins of virus itself. If these supposedly trustworthy expert institutions got all of this basic facts wrong, what business does the government have prosecuting people for medical claims they make? This legislation is ripe for abuse—imagine how much total and inescapable a “vaccine” mandate could be if anyone who questioned the vaccine was prosecuted and imprisoned? The entire principle of bodily autonomy would utterly collapse. But more than any pernicious impact on bodily autonomy, a “disinformation” law throws the door wide open for censorship. The pretext for regulating speech on medical treatment is “public safety”. Once a law which allows censorship for the sake of public safety takes hold, it sets a precedent permitting censorship of any speech as long as it can be tangentially linked to some public safety or national security excuse. The government would easily be able to warp any censorship justification to superficially pertain to public safety. How can anyone argue that the Democrats are not the most authoritarian force in present day American politics when they propose laws such as this? 
2022-09-01;https://www.axios.com/2022/09/01/biden-maga-democracy-primetime-speech;authoritarianism;Biden doubled down labeling the vast majority of Republicans as a “threat to democracy”. This vilification of Democrats’ political opponents hinges on the fact that a very small minority of them participated in a riot at the Capitol Building (shameful as it certainly was) which only the delusional could seriously regard as a “coup”, resulting in 5 fatalities all among the rioters themselves. And yet, at the height of hypocrisy, Democrats chafe at the counter-accusation that they are the threat to democracy when hundreds of thousands of their leftist rioters kill dozens of people and committed tens of billions of dollars in property damage across the nation. Which of these is the REAL threat to the safety and freedom of our society? The more likely rationale for smearing Trump supporters as fascists is that the Democrats know they can’t defeat him in a fair electoral contest, and so are trying to disqualify him and sabotage his movement in advance. It’s much easier to win an election when you persecute and imprison your opponent’s supporters as terrorists. But again, who are the real terrorists: the 2 convicted of an FBI-fabricated plot to kidnap a Democrat governor, or the hundreds of Antifa street thugs setting fire to government buildings, wresting control of city streets away from the legitimate municipal government, and starting firefights in the streets? Who are the real fascists: the conservative Supreme Court justices (whom leftists attempted to assassinate) who let states and their voters decide whether to allow abortions, or the leftists who attempted to force nearly all American workers to take an experimental medical treatment that’s ineffective and more dangerous (for large groups of adults) than the disease it fails to prevent? If Biden wants to find the real authoritarians, he need only look to his Democrat colleagues and the street rabble they allow to run rampant in cities across the nation. 
2022-09-02;https://www.axios.com/2022/09/02/paxlovid-turns-into-pandemic-mystery;COVID;Pfizer’s new COVID pill is so ineffective that even the docile, subservient liberal media is starting to question its effectiveness. There is no shortage of examples of vaccinated individuals taking Paxlovid only to experience a rebound case of COVID. How can any rational person consider a drug “effective” if, when taking it, one gets sick with the disease a second time in a matter of days? This failure has now grown so colossal that the media can’t ignore it. And yet even to this day, there are those on the left who insist that the same pharmaceutical company that made this laughable excuse for a treatment made a safe and effective mRNA shot—the first time such a technology had ever been marketed to the public in human history—immediately prior. When will people start to be skeptical of multi-billion dollar pharma companies and the government officials who simultaneously regulate and hold stock in them?
2022-09-06;https://www.axios.com/2022/09/06/us-health-officials-annual-coronavirus-vaccines;COVID;Despite assurances throughout that pandemic that Americans would not be expected to keep getting more COVID shots, public health figures are now saying that annual COVID booster shots will become the norm. Initially, drug companies and government regulators and physicians indicated that the basic 2-dose course would be all that is necessary to protect the vaccinated against COVID. Then 6 months later these same figures assured us that only 1 more booster dose would be necessary. Then it was a 4th shot 6 months after that. But in the face of mounting skepticism, these so-called “experts” insisted that they were not attempting to push an annual drug on the American public. Now they are changing their tune again. This goes to show that these self-appointed experts are completely bankrupt of credibility. They act as though Americans are too stupid or fearful to see through the transparent ploy to make more money off of a historical period that was traumatic to many. Pfizer clearly views their record profits, an order of magnitude higher than is typical, as insufficient. The mRNA “vaccine” no longer works, though we shall see if the updated booster improves its efficacy any, and yet public health officials, who overwhelmingly skew left and support the left’s political agenda, think nothing of encouraging Americans to take a dose every year indefinitely. This is the increasingly obvious hallmark of the left: they care nothing for peoples’ actual well-being, but only for their own profits. 
2022-09-09;https://twitter.com/charliekirk11/status/1568308710363254784;authoritarianism;According to Bannon, 35 high-level Trump allies have had their homes raided by the FBI. This statement, of course, should be taken with a grain of salt, as Bannon is not the most trustworthy individual. If this is true, though, it would mark a serious escalation in the Democrats’ persecution of their political opponents. It was one, already brazen thing to raid Trump’s home to supposedly recover documents he improperly removed from the White House. It is possible that the case is truly as the FBI claims. But how does the FBI explain raiding dozens of Trump allies barely a month later, and less than 2 months before a midterm election which the Democrats are still very vulnerable to losing? Are these Trump allies, who are uniformly moronic and incompetent, part of a vast conspiracy to steal classified documents? Or is this just the pro-Democrat FBI’s attempt to help their political faction by vilifying Trump’s entire political movement? Which of those is more likely? If it is truly as Bannon accuses, this would be the most dangerous escalation of authoritarianism in America yet, with the Democrats leading the charge. Again, to apply the classic test of equivalency, if the FBI under Trump raided the homes of 35 high-ranking Biden allies, Democrat voters would literally start a civil war. Yet when Biden does so, the same Democrats who wailed “we don’t prosecute our political opponents” are only too happy to send federal law enforcement to hunt down every Trump ally of any standing. I challenge any Democrat apologist to claim this isn’t the very essence of authoritarianism. 
2022-09-09;https://twitter.com/sencortezmasto/status/1568265464027185153;authoritarianism;Democrats in the Senate are attempting to expand the reach of their censorship to stifle crisis pregnancy centers, which merely attempt to counsel pregnant women without offering abortions. The Democrats’ game is utterly transparent at this point: control speech by claiming to fight “disinformation”, a designation which is decreed arbitrarily by pro-left bureaucratic “experts”. In essence, disinformation is whatever Democrats and their allies say it is, and so laws like this would arm the government with the legal right to silence any speech so designated, in flagrant violation of the First Amendment. The Democrats are zealous in their crusade to silence all dissent to their whims. In this case, for instance, Democrats can’t simply let every state decide what services to offer (or not offer) to pregnant women. Every American in every state, in the Democrats’ view, must be made to bow to their proclamations. That is as un-American as one can imagine. Our nation has thrived because of its multiplicity of cultures and views, and the vigorous debate that stems from it. The Democrats walk the path of turning our nation into a one-party state akin to China where only a narrow band of views within authorized doctrine are allowed. Even if one agrees with the Democrats’ views (as articulated at the present moment), one should still shudder at the though of the government controlling speech, for one can one day find oneself in disagreement with the latest Democrat proclamation. But by then it will be too late. 
2022-09-10;https://www.axios.com/2022/09/10/homicides-down-midyear-overall-violent-crime-up;law enforcement;Violent crime continues to rise across the nation, predominantly in multi-generational Democrat-stronghold cities. The Democrats claim to be devoted to reducing crime and also the burden on the criminal justice system, and yet under their reign both only worsen. In fact, there is a direct correlation between the leftward bent of municipal government policies and the crime rates. And yet when confronted with this, Democrats only respond with excuses. They blame the pandemic (even though the associated restrictions and economic privations are over, they blame Republicans even though practically zero Republicans are in power in the municipalities leading the rise in violent crime, and they blame the failings of the inner-city public school system which they overwhelmingly control. This is classic Democrat behavior: cause the problem and then blame everyone else for it. Democrats crushed the economy with lockdowns that saved a minuscule number of lives. Democrats eliminated cash bail and exercised lenient prosecutorial discretion to let offenders run around unchecked. Democrats create social programs that make the poor dependent instead of self-sufficient. And because cities are also full of loyal wealthy Democrat voters, they now have to suffer the consequences of their extreme policies. It is only too bad that others who wanted no part in their radical social experiment are paying the price as well. 
2022-09-11;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1569094462386892800;authoritarianism;The Democrats and their faithful media servants are using the anniversary of the 9/11 tragedy to make veiled insinuations that their political opponents on the right are a threat of the same degree and character as the hijackers who killed more than 3000 Americans 21 years ago. The messaging they’ve chosen is to state that the “threat form within” the country could be greater than the external threat of extremist state and non-state actors. However, anyone with even passing familiar with the political landscape since Trump’s election knows that the “threat from within” almost invariably means the right—it began as far-right extremists and gradually seeped to the left to characterize anyone to the right of the meekest centrist Republicans. If one were to ask Harris or the Democrats’ media thralls if Antifa was part of this “threat from within”, they would almost certainly say “no” despite the fact that Antifa—and not ANY right-wing entity—is the only group in the last 10 years to literally seize control of blocks of multiple American cities from their lawfully elected governments. They certainly would vehemently refute that Black Lives Matter, whose mobilization of millions resulted in tens of billions of dollars in property damage and the deaths of dozens of people, represents any kind of threat to America whatsoever (even if an unintentional threat). So again, it is clear that, in using a nationwide day of mourning to allude to “threats from within”, Democrats are putting the right, and no other politically aligned extremists, squarely in the crosshairs. 
2022-09-12;https://twitter.com/rasmussen_poll/status/1569367735364030464;authoritarianism;4 out of 5 Democrats view democratically elected Trump and his Republican allies, the core of the entire Republican party, as a threat to democracy in America. How is it not the height of hypocrisy that the Democrats condemn a democratically elected (Republican) leader as a threat to democracy, yet even the Republicans who insist that the Democrats stole the 2020 election don’t make similar accusations against the Democrats? The notion that pro-Trump Republicans are a threat to democracy rests solely on the supposed “insurrection” on January 6, 2021, which contained laughably disorganized and under-equipped rioters (compared to the highest degree of organization and equipment that group of people COULD have brought to bear had they chosen to) for a supposed “coup” and thus never had any chance of overthrowing the US government. The January 6 Riot, shameful as it was, is merely a pretext for Democrats to ban the Republican party, fulfilling their authoritarian project as the so many left-wing tyrannies before them have. If 4 out of every 5 members of the party with undisputed cultural, media, and economic dominance in the US believes, truly or cynically, that their political opponents are undemocratic, then who will stop the disbanding of the Republican party, and the creation of a one-party state? Who would dare stand up to 80% of the ascendant political faction to defend an “anti-democratic” party? Every American should see the prevalence of this belief for how extraordinarily dangerous it is. 
2022-09-15;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1570452639900639233;immigration;When illegal migrants were flooding through the nation’s southern border and straining the (mainly Republican-voting) communities in that area, the left extended no help and merely stated that America should take in every illegal migrant, but now that illegal migrants are being relocated to their wealthy communities, the left is in an uproar that THEY should be made to accommodate the migrants. For decades, the left cared nothing for the plight of border communities as their resources were stretched to the breaking point. Instead, the left stubbornly advanced its open border policy and insisted that border communities just deal with it. But now that southern states are sharing the load, which until now rested solely on those border communities, with the same affluent leftists who pushed the policy that caused the tidal wave of illegal migrants, these leftists are pitching a fit. To the left, it is intolerable that they as the ones who threw open our borders should have to personally accommodate the people who came through those open borders. It doesn’t get more hypocritical than that. Ideological consistency demands that anyone who wants open borders should be prepared to personally house and feed the people who immigrate to our country as a result. And in the case of migrants being flown to Martha’s Vineyard, one of the most affluent communities in the world, the residents there have more than enough means of putting their money where their mouth is. And yet they childishly refuse, and they refuse to admit they don’t practice what they preach. They believe that the consequences of their actions are for others to suffer, and not for themselves. This is bad enough in itself, but then they have the audacity to liken southern states’ efforts to even out the load of illegal migrants to the acts of the Nazis. Put more bluntly, the left is likening transporting migrants to the wealthiest, safest, most exclusive communities in the world to the Holocaust’s forced relocation of the Jews to concentration camps. How twisted does your worldview have to be to make such an absurd and tasteless comparison? Only the left has a worldview this twisted. 
2022-09-15;https://www.axios.com/2022/09/15/desantis-marthas-vineyard-migrants-biden;authoritarianism;On top of the previously noted hypocrisy on the part of the left in complaining that THEY now have to take care of the illegal migrants they made southern (mostly Republican) states take care of for the whole span of their open border policy, now the left is trying to legally coerce these states into stopping. To appreciate the staggering scope of this hypocrisy, here is how the consequences of the left’s immigration policies played out. First, the left pursued a policy, for more than a decade, in which they allowed any illegal migrant crossing into the US to remain in the country without consequence. Second, throughout that time, the left offered no help when communities on the border asked for help dealing with the economic consequences of letting untold numbers of new people flow into their communities. Third, when the states containing these border communities sent a token number of illegal migrants to the affluent leftist communities that lobbied to let these migrants in, these leftist communities vocally protested. And now fourth, the left is trying to force southern states to stop sending affluent leftists communities the illegal migrants that the left let in (which are overwhelming communities in southern states). This latest chapter in the radical left immigration policy saga goes to show that the left never had any compassion for illegal migrants. The left only let these migrants in when said migrants stayed out of sight and imposed no negative consequences on them. As soon as these leftists are in a position to directly help the migrants they claim to stand for, they can’t wriggle out of it fast enough. Not only that, but the left has the audacity to punish southern states for trying to share the load of illegal migrants with the rest of the country. 
2022-09-17;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98uDUg7YK6g;crime;Despite Democrats’ vocal claims to want to act to stop mass shootings, especially in schools, Democrats refuse to so much as voice their arguments against a bill which funds the staffing of additional police officers and mental health professionals in schools. Not only do most Democrats, particularly those who are most adamantly in favor of gun control, refuse to vote for legislation which provides more security and mental health resources to students, but they won’t so much as state their reasons for rejecting the legislation. How is this in any way consistent with Democrats’ stated desire to stop mass shootings? Rather than make strides to prevent mass shootings by providing mental health treatment options dissuading students from lashing out, or resisting mass shootings with armed police officers, the Democrats are only interested in trying to limit legal access to firearms as much as possible. They are hell-bent on this approach despite the fact that it is demonstrably useless, as seen in every Democrats stronghold city where guns are nearly impossible for anyone to get and yet somehow shootings happen daily. Anyone who wants to kill the innocent will find a way to obtain the tools for doing so. The law will rarely stop them. The Democrats would rather double down on this failed approach than reduce the desire to kill in troubled youth or oppose force with force. How does this make any sense? Even if the Democrats refuse to abandon gun control, why not supplement it with more mental health professionals and law enforcement officers, especially when Republicans are willing to embrace this tactic? These actions by the Democrats are not the actions of leaders who sincerely wish to stop bloodshed—if that was the Democrats’ goal, they would gladly back this legislation and then decide whether to pursue gun control further. So what is the true aim of the Democrats? It seems as though it is to allow violent crime to run rampant to justify more security powers for themselves. 
2022-09-19;https://www.axios.com/2022/09/20/migrants-custody-border-surge;immigration;More illegal immigrants have come to the US border this year than ever before, and the year isn’t even over yet. Given this clear evidence, how can anyone argue that the Democrats are not the party of open borders? The radicals in the party are at least open about this policy goal. But the Democrats on the whole pretend to favor a compromise wherein they grant amnesty to illegal migrants already settled here while tightening border enforcement. There is no way that all 2 million of these border crossers were apprehended and either detained or sent back—this would simply be logistically impossible, as the US does not have the resources. So the only remaining possibility is that some proportion of these 2 million illegal migrants were allowed to simply enter the country unopposed. In this way, the Democrats get to pursue their real agenda of letting anyone into our country who desires it, without any regard for national security, while still maintaining the pretense that they are trying to enforce immigration law in the face of immense flows of people. Any president addressing immigration faces a tricky situation, there’s no doubt about it. But the Democrats are barely trying to hide their embrace of open borders. Indeed, the fact that record numbers of people have attempted to cross into the US shows that there is a clear perception that Biden will let anyone in who wants in—if these migrants didn’t sincerely believe that, they wouldn’t risk their lives to attempt the dangerous crossing.
2022-09-20;https://twitter.com/againstgrmrs/status/1572115130242179073;authoritarianism;An organization of LGBT individuals working to prevent child abuse had their PayPal and Venmo accounts shut down purely because they challenge the prevailing leftist radical progressive sexual identity agenda. The left’s radical but relentless vanguard has been exposed repeatedly—at school board meetings, reports in conservative news outlets, and leaks on social media—for introducing sexually mature content and ideas to minors and pushing them them toward embracing LGBT identities (particularly transgender identities). This effort takes many forms: allowing books with pornagraphic content in school libraries (e.g. Gender Queer by Maia Kobabe), putting on erotic dance performances (under the pretext of an LGBT inclusivity event) involving minors in schools, hosting summer camps for minors featuring erotic subject matter, and overall permitting the free rein of sex-related topics in the classroom (outside the bounds of the standard sex ed curriculum). Gays Against Groomers is a group of LGBT individuals who seek to put a stop to this initiative by the left, particularly since it creates an undeservedly negative perception of the LGBT community as a whole, most of whom seek only to live their lives without bothering anyone like everyone else. How is a group with a mission such as this, preventing the exposure of minors to sexually mature material, objectionable to anyone in any way? Who has the nerve to argue that this is wrong? And yet this group was kneecapped from accepting donations by two of the biggest online payment processors. What could possibly be the justification for this? It seems as though the answer is that the left is sore that this push to expose minors to sexual content has been succinctly and pointedly distilled into the term “groomer”, and the term has been allowed to spread like wildfire. If “groomer” didn’t apply to what the radical left is doing, then what need would they have to prevent anyone from uttering the term—they could simply brush it off and say “that’s an absurd and groundless accusation, with no facts to back it up”. But the left didn’t do that. Instead, the backlash was savage. This is the behavior of someone who is guilty. Everyone knows that if you accuse a person of something and they react with histrionics and attempt to silence you (rather than rationally disputing the allegation with counter-facts), that is almost the surest sign they’re guilty. This is exactly the case with the left’s hissy fit about being called “groomers”. The deplatforming of Gays Against Groomers is material proof of the existence of this hissy fit.

Greenwald is right on the mark in his characterization of the situation. The Democrats repeatedly claim that the justice system is unfair and that people should truly be presumed innocent until proven guilty. But of course, the Democrats operate almost exclusively on double-standards, and so the unspoken reality is that presumption of innocence only applied to those the Democrats favor. If the Democrats disfavor you, you are vilified until you prove your innocence. This is precisely the in-group privileges versus out-group persecution that is the hallmark of authoritarianism, especially since the press and every major tech platform snaps into line with whatever the Democrats pronounce. This pairing of the pro-Democrat double-standard with the de facto Democrat colonization of the media and the Internet that makes this vein of authoritarianism truly insidious. 
2022-10-03;https://www.cspicenter.com/p/diverse-and-divided-a-political-demography;identity;The left insists that no one would ever adopt an LGBT identity as a fad, and yet a study shows that more than 1 in every 3 liberal arts students identifies as LGBT. Is the left seriously prepared to argue that 1 in 3 people are LGBT in their heart of hearts, and that none of those people are just trying to jump on the bandwagon that the left itself popularized and promoted? The left has spent the last few years heaping praise on LGBT people and elevating them to a higher social status in left circles. And considering that the college-age demographic (Gen Z) is well-known to be conformist and desperate for attention and validation from their peers, is the left seriously going to pretend that not a single one of these people is just posing as LGBT for the attention? While it is undoubtedly true that America is more accepting of LGBT people than it has ever been, there is no way that this is the reason for the explosion in LGBT identification—the left’s narrative, that 1 in 3 Americans have always been LGBT but only NOW they feel safe enough to come out, is statistically impossible. Our society would literally have collapsed if 1 in 3 people were forced to integrate into a society which (until 10 years ago) only officially sanctioned heterosexual relationships. Same-sex marriage was legalized 10 years ago, which would have been the most likely point in time to see a bump in LGBT identification due to widespread acceptance. What we are seeing now is Gen Z sheeple glomming onto a fad. Ironically, the same people who decry homophobia engage in the most homophobic possible behavior: trivializing LGBT identities by treating them as a costume to be worn to win empty praise from their peers. 
2022-10-05;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/05/covid-boosters-study;COVID;While trying to push the latest iteration of the COVID mRNA “vaccine”, a study from a top-tier medical school unintentionally suggests that the current strain of COVID is far weaker than previous ones. A paper form Yale estimates that 90,000 American lives could be saved by wide adoption of the latest booster shot, which has supposedly been retooled to the mRNA sequence of the Omicron variant. However, when compared to the 1 million Americans who died from COVID to this point, the prospective death toll of not distributing the shot is not even 10% of that. To further put these numbers into proper context, the fatality rate from COVID was already a fraction of a percent. So the fact that the projected deaths from not taking the new boosters is 1/10 of less than a percent strongly suggests that COVID is nothing to worry about for most Americans at this point. And yet in spite of this, the left-leaning elite establishment is still pushing the COVID shots anyway. No matter, to them, that the shot is so ineffective that more vaccinated people are testing positive for COVID than unvaccinated, according to data from Walgreens. No matter, to them, that Biden declared the pandemic to be over. In spire of all of this, the public health establishment (which skews left politically) is still angling to get more Americans to take an ineffective vaccine to guard against a mild viral infection. Why? The explanation which is more likely—more likely than that they are investing immense time and effort to fighting a virus which poses little risk to most people—is that the public health institutions and government is in bed with the pharmaceutical industry. Pharma giants fund a not-insignificant proportion of the FDA’s budget, and fund a staggering number of research institutions. In return for being showered with cash, these organizations push the pharmaceutical industry’s products even when there is little sense in it. How can we trust these people to look out for our well-being when they so willingly serve corporations over patients?
2022-10-07;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63167947;foreign policy;Biden warns that the world is the closest to nuclear war since the Cuban Missile Crisis, as though this reality is not primarily his fault. As soon as the 2016 election made it apparent that Trump would lead the country, the left wailed that Trump would lead us to a nuclear war. And yet under his presidency, America was further from nuclear annihilation than under Obama and certainly than under Biden. The world has reached this precipice because Biden has the audacity to poke Russia on what Russia has stated is its vital national security interest. Whether Ukraine is, in fact, a vital national security interest to Russia is irrelevant: what matters is that Russia has stated, numerous times consistently for decades, that this is the case, so we can assume they will act accordingly. As stated here before, Russia has declared that they will not tolerate the absorption of Ukraine into NATO or the Western European sphere, and they demonstrated the seriousness of their resolve in the annexation of Crimea in 2014. Yet Biden decided to push Russia anyway, caring little for the fact that Ukraine would pay the price for his bravado. Then when hostilities inevitably broke out as a result of Biden’s posturing, the Biden administration had the further audacity to funnel arms and intelligence to Ukraine to field against Russia without making the slightest attempt to hide it. In other words, Biden made it clear to Russia that we are at war with it by proxy, at war in a conflict Russia regards as a matter of national life and death. Any 9-year-old who has gotten into playground fights could tell you that Russia would respond the way they did, and yet Biden pushed matters anyway. So after backing Russia into a corner, Biden dares to complain that the specter of nuclear war is looming? America could have avoided this by (1) leaving well enough alone by allowing a pro-Western government in Ukraine but refusing to allow them into the EU or NATO, or failing that (2) letting Ukraine fight Russia alone. Instead, Biden elected to make the most dangerous possible move, and then can’t understand how we got here. How is it that the left half of the country isn’t completely terrified that such a man leads the nation? Every single American should be alarmed by this, and no American who supported Biden has any right to criticize Trump’s foreign policy when he maintained the status quo and even made strides toward further stabilization (e.g. by paving the way to Saudi Arabian normalization of relations with Israel).
2022-10-07;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63166809;corruption;The left criticized Trump’s children (fairly) for unscrupulous business practices and insisted that their candidates’ families met a higher ethical standard, and yet now Hunter Biden’s conduct has become so egregious that Biden’s own federal government is investigating him for tax fraud. Anyone who has read objective reporting for the past many years knows that Hunter Biden conducts himself with no ethics whatsoever. And yet in spite of this the left still insists that the Bidens are honorable people, and nowhere near as slimy as the Trumps. Now the left can’t hide from the truth anymore. The worst thing you can do as the family member of a public servant is to avoid bearing your share of civic responsibility in this country: not paying taxes, not serving for jury duty, and other pillars of our democracy. Hunter Biden has proven, on numerous occasions long before the 2020 election, that he has no allegiance to the United States, as he has accepted millions of dollars from companies closely tied to foreign governments. Yet the left did not lose a wink of sleep over this. They didn’t even entertain the thought of putting up a candidate with higher ethical standards than Biden (they must have at least ONE politician who fits the bill). The Democrats now have no right to accuse any Republican of ethical failings when their own are at least as grave. 
2022-10-07;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/07/new-york-adams-emergency-migrant-buses;immigration;After receiving barely a few thousand migrants from Texas, the tiniest fraction of the number Texas itself has to handle every year, New York City declared a state of emergency over their supposed “migrant crisis”. As previously noted, the US has counted 2 million illegal migrants this year alone. This means that Texas has easily had to process hundreds of thousands of migrants every year for decades (recall that Bush attempted to address immigration in the early 2000s). Texas and the other border states face much more acute crisis than New York City, and yet neither New York nor any of the other perma-Democrat states expressed any sympathy for the border states facing waves of migrants. It’s also pretty hypocritical of New York to brush off the migrant influx at first and brag about how welcome migrants are to then turn around and call the incoming migrants an “emergency”. Isn’t that the same as saying they aren’t welcome? If incoming migrants lead to an emergency, and emergencies are viewed as undesirable, then the state absorbing these incoming migrants can be said to not want incoming migrants. It just goes to show how the Democrats are insincere about all the compassion they profess to have. The compassion ends as soon as it becomes inconvenient to the left. They wanted migrants, so they have no business complaining now that they have migrants aplenty. 
2022-10-13;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/13/fcc-ban-huawei-zte-equipment;authoritarianism;When Trump moved to ban Chinese telecom and computer manufacturers from the US, the Democrats condemned him as a racist, but when Biden does the same thing, one hears not a peep from the Democrats. The Democrats have no principles and no sense of shame: they will embrace any argument, in bad faith, that will discredit and slander their opponents, but then will feel utterly uninhibited from doing exactly that which they condemned. The Democrats are especially egregious in regards to their beliefs on race: they claim to be the champions of racial justice, yet they are willing to do that which they called racist not 4 years ago. It shows how little the Democrats actually care for improving race relations in this country. In fact, it makes the Democrats more racist: what could possibly be more racist than the way the Democrats use race as a prop for political grandstanding?
2022-10-13;https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63233078;economy;The Democrats still have no handle on the economy, as runaway inflation continues.

Not only are their plans inadequate, but they can’t even succeed at THOSE.

The Democrats campaigned on delivering to the American people a healthier, more prosperous economy than Trump. And they campaigned during COVID, meaning they were already prepared to account for the setbacks presented by the pandemic. And yet every economic measure that comes out cements the fact that the Democrats are destroying the economy with their incompetence. And they have no excuse because, as Biden himself said, the pandemic is over. They can’t say COVID is setting them back because COVID is no longer an emergency. They talked a big game, they have no more excuses, and now they can’t deliver. 
2022-10-15;https://www.bbc.com/news/health-63247997;health;The companies that manufactured the ineffective COVID gene therapies are now boasting that they will be able to develop mRNA technology to cure cancer. How does BioNTech think that their track record with the COVID jab should inspire any confidence in anyone that they can tackle cancer? They produced a shot that they claimed would stop the spread of COVID and would prevent patients from developing a case of COVID. The evidence is now clear that the mRNA shots don’t stop the spread, and they don’t stop you from catching COVID (as data from Walgreens shows that the vaccinated test positive for COVID at a higher rate than the unvaccinated). There’s not even any proof that the “vaccine” reduces the severity of COVID, many vaccinated patients have gotten seriously ill, been hospitalized, and have died from COVID. So the mRNA gene therapy is a failure on all fronts: it does nothing an effective vaccine should be expected to do. And now they want us to believe that their vaccine was such a success that we should expect them to take the same technology and eventually defeat cancer? The pharma companies also clearly think we’re the stupidest people imaginable, because they talk about how long mRNA has been tested, yest this does not line up with their claims to this point even slightly. When the mRNA COVID jab manufacturers announced their product, they made one of two claims that don’t stand up to critical reasoning. One, they insisted that it was a brand new product and that testing had to be expedited to combat the pandemic, which contradicts the claim that mRNA has has years of testing. Alternatively, two, they promised that mRNA was somehow safe because it had been tested for decades but yet was somehow never approved for human use until conveniently right as a global pandemic started. How does any thinking person believe that the “vaccine” was safe if it had gone decades without approval but then was suddenly approved when the US government was so desperate to fight COVID that they were willing to approve almost anything as long as it didn’t kill more people than COVID? So what is it, drug companies? Is this tech brand new (and ineffective), making it too nascent to claim has promise against cancer? Or is this tech old and questionable because it took a global pandemic to be approved after decades of failed testing? Either way, clearly no one with any power to hold big pharma accountable—namely journalists (mostly Democrat supporters) or government officials (mostly Democrats as of this article’s publication)—because these companies went from duping all billions of patients by pushing an ineffective treatment to trying to sell us all another lie. But why would the Democrats and their faithful servants do anything to stop this when they take billions of dollars from these very same pharma companies? It could well be that pharma-funded Republicans would do no better. But then again, it’s the Democrats that profess to be the party of “the science”—for such believers in science, they sure don’t seem to want to follow the data here.

Isn’t it funny how the Democrats (Biden in particular) are guilty of all the things they accused Trump of? How on Earth can the Democrats claim to pursue responsible foreign policy when they are bringing the world the closest it has ever been to nuclear annihilation because of their delusion that Russia is a global menace?...which they assure us has nothing to do with their claim that Russia stole the 2016 election for Trump... but somehow they also claim that it’s only the Republicans who allege any election was ever stolen (and that they CERTAINLY have never done so). The Democrats also love to deny the fact that their highest leadership, namely the Bidens, take enormous sums of money from Ukraine. So, when we tally up the score, we see that the Democrats are pushing the world to the edge of nuclear oblivion all so that the Bidens can keep getting bought by corrupt Ukrainian businessmen and so that they can get revenge on Russia for stealing the 2016 election for Trump, all while denying they think the 2016 election was stolen (and condemning the Republicans for daring to suggest 2020 was stolen for Biden). The Democrats have proven, by the actions they took openly for all the world to see, that they are complete lunatics.

The Democrats constantly lambasted Trump for golfing so often (which, to give them credit, was a fair criticism), but yet now when the world is on the precipice of the extinction of the human species, which the Democrats THEMSELVES caused, their president is out wasting his time instead of governing. Anyone who supports the Democrats is never allowed to criticize Republicans for inattentiveness to their duty ever again, considering how negligent they are and how much is at stake. Never.

How inept does a party have to be to hold power during an economic downturn, not campaign on the economic policy, let their opponents extensively campaign on how bad the economy is and how they have a plan to fix it, and then be shocked when they aren’t projected to do well against the opponents? A 9-year-old could tell you that these are the kind of people who don’t seem at all qualified to be in charge of the largest economy in the world. And yet the Democrats themselves don’t think they need to convince anyone they have a more refined plan for the economy. On top of that, with their campaign strategy being what it is, how is it that the Democrats can make ANY claim to be on the side of poor and working class Americans? These are the people who are most vulnerable to economic downturns. The elite clientele that the Democrats attract cant weather limping economies—they just pay more for things and grumble. In essence, then, the Democrats are too stupid or too arrogant to address the issue of most concern to the groups they claim to fight for the hardest: the middle- and low-income classes. 
2022-10-18;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/18/china-seize-taiwan-plans-moving-much-faster-blinken;foreign policy;China is accelerating its timetable for conquering Taiwan coincidentally as the US government shows itself to be feebler and feebler. What’s more likely, that this rapid pivot toward a Chinese invasion of Taiwan—something they have held off on doing for 70 years—during the Biden presidency is pure happenstance, or that they see an extraordinarily ripe opportunity posed by American foreign policy ineptitude. Does anyone seriously think that America’s disastrously botched withdrawal from Afghanistan and its inability to deter Russian aggression in Ukraine didn’t signal to Beijing that they have a uniquely promising shot on Taiwan? And how can any thinking person argue that Biden’s foreign policy is superior to Trump’s? Russia made no moves on Ukraine under Trump. In fact, Trump signed sanctions against Russia into law, and advised Germany to wean itself off of Russian petroleum products, to which the Germans literally laughed in his face. I doubt they’re laughing now, with winter approaching and skyrocketing heating fuel costs. Meanwhile, Russia began its annexation of Ukrainian territory under Obama, and continued it to its present intensity under Biden. Trump, though clumsily so, also pushed back on China’s maritime incursions into foreign territorial waters far more than Biden has dared to do (though credit to Pelosi for not backing down from visiting Taiwan). So is it just 16 years of coincidence that China has been aggressive while Democrats were president and reserved while Republicans were president, or is it that Democrats are extraordinarily incompetent on foreign policy?

How stupid do you have to be to reduce our military fuel stockpile days after intelligence analysts say we’re the closest to war with one of the world’s top conventional militaries that we’ve ever been? And why is Biden doing this? All because his party was too inept to do anything to fix the economy, and now they’re at such a high risk of being crushed in the midterm election that he is scrambling to lower gas prices and fool Americans into thinking the Democrats have any idea what they’re doing with the economy. Democrats would only be too happy to smugly say the same if the shoe was on the other foot and it was Trump dipping into our oil reserves to help his party out. Aren’t the Democrats also the party that believes we all need to switch to electric cars ASAP and every ounce of oil burned is inching us closer to a climate apocalypse? So why is Biden giving America more oil? This is one of hundreds of other data points that show that the Democrats stand for nothing, and will do anything to get elected. They have no principles, no ethics, and no consistency. They are hypocrites of the highest order. Worse, they are backing America into a corner when our place in the world is under the greatest threat in generations, because they’re too stupid and greedy to know better. 
2022-10-19;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/20/democrats-black-latino-voters-republicans;identity;The Democrats, who claim to be the devoted champions of  “antiracism” and “people of color”, are currently deathly afraid that they won’t win enough of the non-white vote in the upcoming midterm election. In fact, a major component of Democrat campaigning is screaming and crying about how everyone who disagrees with them is racist. So how do they explain the rapid departure of non-white voters from their support base? If the Republicans are so racist, how come more and more racial minorities are supporting the Republicans? To continue to maintain that Republicans are so racist would require Democrats to accuse these racial minority voters of being too stupid to see the supposed blatant racism of the Republicans. So what is it, Democrats: are racial minorities who don’t support you too stupid to see racism, or are the Republicans (as a whole) just actually not racist? It should be stated for the sake of clarity that there is no merit to the argument that non-white voters are any less intelligent or discerning. Therefore, the only rational explanation is that these voters simply don’t see the Republicans as racist. What they likely see in the Republicans is a group that is ACTUALLY concerned with their well-being by addressing economic issues. When are the Democrats going to admit that their accusations of racism are just empty political posturing and actually pursue policy? 
2022-10-20;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/20/college-enrollment-pandemic-covid-19;education;Despite the fact that the pandemic is “over”, enrollment at institutions of higher education is still dropping. Why is this? The strongest correlation with these enrollment trends is obviously the pandemic, but that does not in itself indicate what particular factor of the pandemic was responsible, or even whether it was a first- or second-order effect. Is it because colleges and universities are the last and stubbornest bastions of vaccine mandates and other COVID policies in our society? Is it because students discovered that they were paying immense sums of money to learn online when comparable online training was available for a fraction of the cost? Is it because young people are disillusioned with higher education overall? Is it because this highly vaccinated population (college students) is somehow experiencing an exploding mortality rate? (From COVID, probably not, but from effects of the vaccine, still probably not but more likely given all the vaccinated college age athletes mysteriously collapsing.) What do all of these possible explanations have in common? They are all the direct result of rabid leftists. Polling proves beyond doubt that US (and Canadian) college campuses are the most left-wing enclaves in Western civilization, possibly the world—even China believes in capitalism. Not coincidentally, colleges are also practically the only places that still have vaccine mandates. They’re also the places where leftist activism is so rampant that it has diluted and co-opted all fields of study to the point that degrees indicate almost no academic rigor. To any who oppose this claim, that left activism weakens academic rigor, I will direct you to numerous scientific journals that have explicitly declared that they will not publish scientific conclusions, even in the face of overwhelming empirical evidence, which impede or oppose left political causes. So it sure sounds like universities are less and less inclined to teach any subjects or perspectives that reflect poorly on the left. In fact, students who wish to pursue high-paying careers in technical fields may find that online training is superior and more cost effective than a post-secondary degree. Show me a social problem, and I’ll show you a leftist.  
2022-10-22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_WTZo9ieBKY;COVID;After spending the last 2 years hysterical about the dangers of the pandemic and simultaneously insisting they would never conduct dangerous “gain of function” research, scientists working for the Democrats have spliced together a strain of COVID that killed 80% of the mice it was tested on. As a result of the pandemic, the Democrats have appointed themselves the champions of public health, ripping into the Republicans at every turn for supposedly not taking public health seriously enough. And when the Republicans accused the Democrats’ idol Fauci of illegally funding gain of function research on coronavirus strains in Wuhan, Fauci and the Democrats insisted that they would never fund such research because of the immense risk that dangerous pathogens escape the lab and cause a pandemic. And yet mere weeks after Biden declared that the pandemic was over, a study was published reporting that scientists in Boston had spliced together different strains of SARS-CoV-2 to create a pathogen with an 80% fatality rate in mice with humanized genetic features. Especially given the fact that a lab leak was the most likely origin of COVID-19, and how the Democrats boast of prioritizing public health, how is it they can possibly justify reckless gain of function research which yielded a chimeric coronavirus? How is this even remotely responsible? Even other scientists have spoken out calling the research alarming and wildly irresponsible. And make no mistakes, this research was Democrats’ doing: Democrats run the White House and Congress which would fund this research, Democrats are the most intimately in bed with the bioresearch and pharmaceutical industries, and scientific and research institutions across the country are lined with Democrat supporters (the vast majority of academics identify with the left). There is no way this was some Republican initiative when they hold next to no power at the federal level currently. In fact, this research was impossible while Trump was president, because the Omicron variant, which was used as part of the chimera’s genetic material, didn’t exist before November 2021 when Biden had been president for nearly a year. Anyone arguing that the Democrats are responsible on the matter of public health have no leg to stand on: they can’t claim the Democrats weren’t involved in this research, they can’t claim this research isn’t the very gain of function research that Fauci denied, and they can’t even remotely claim this is a good idea. 
2022-10-23;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/23/joe-biden-msnbc-interview-democracy;authoritarianism;Once again, Biden is implying that supporting the Democrats’ opponents is destroying democracy. Isn’t it an interesting coincidence that Biden always seems to make these comments whenever polls come out showing the Democrats are on track to be crushed in the next election? But it must be stressed how dangerous his insinuations are. By all but openly stating that the opposing party is anti-democratic, it legitimizes the use of any tactic to destroy them. If we assume the Democrats’ framing of events, there can be only 2 outcomes: either the Republicans win and America descends into fascism, or the Democrats win and democracy is saved. But what if the so-called fascists have enough popular support to win a free and fair election? From that perspective, because democracy is a good in and of itself, then it is acceptable to preserve it by any means necessary... including by anti-democratic measures. In other words, if the other side winning means democracy dies anyway, then what’s the harm in engaging in undemocratic behavior, just this ONE time, to stop them? It’s either no democracy for one election or no democracy forever. And hence, the Democrats have opened the door to cheating to win elections. This is the stuff of Greek tragedies: to become like the enemy to defeat the enemy. Does this mean the Democrats are certain to cheat? Of course not. But the rhetoric they are using opens the door to that possibility: by framing the other side as evil, the Democrats back themselves into a corner where they must be willing to do anything to prevail, or be seen as capitulating to evil in the eyes of their voters. If you call your enemy evil, your supporters will now demand you defeat evil no matter what it takes, or they will turn on you. Interestingly, in adopting these talking points, the Democrats have done what they long accused Trump of: whipping up their base into a rabid mob. Because of the words Biden has used to vilify the other side, rank and file Democrat voters view Republicans are pure evil. In fact, we have already crossed a dangerous line, in which Democrat supporters have committed violence against Republicans: years ago, a Sanders supporter tried to assassinate multiple Republican congressmen. Sadly, I predict that this is not the last we will see of such violence because again, the Democrats have left no room to deescalate their initiative to delegitimize and dismantle the Republican party. Republican leaders have never so much as suggested that the Democrats are evil, anti-democratic, or should be disbanded. Some of them have merely claimed that the Democrats cheated in one singular election. But this is very different from saying that the Democrats are anti-democratic to the core and need to be stopped to preserve the republic, as the Democrats have said of the Republicans. So who are the real fascists? 
2022-10-24;https://twitter.com/JonLemire/status/1584602902261161986;foreign policy;Biden is being so aggressive and escalatory with Russia that dozens of elected members of his own party are speaking out. With the gradually less frequent exception of the radical left wing of the party, the Democrats are always in lockstep on policy. This is especially true of foreign policy—even the left wing’s fussing about Palestine has subsided as they’ve realized it has no chance of wholesale adoption by the Democrats. And especially on Russia, every Democrat is in agreement that Russia is the incarnation of evil and must be opposed at all costs—which, they assure us, has NOTHING to do with their loss to Trump in 2016 despite their adamant insistence that it was due to Russian interference. So the fact that Biden’s dangerous escalation of hostility with Russia is so concerning that it overrides these dissenting Democrats’ hatred of Russia really says something. 
2022-10-25;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1584992350245638144;COVID;Despite the fact that white Americans are vaccinated at much higher rates than black Americans, white Americans are now the ones with a significantly higher rates of COVID. There is now no shortage of evidence that the mRNA COVID “vaccines” are worse than useless. In particular, multiple sources now indicate that the vaccinated test positive for COVID at higher rates than the unvaccinated. These latest reports only reinforce this trend. In fact, this latest report is especially illuminating, because, in the US, black people are more likely than white people to work blue-collar jobs that require them to be in-person in large groups of people. Correspondingly, white people in America are more likely to work office jobs, many of which still allow working from home. This means that white Americans are catching COVID at higher rates than black Americans DESPITE the fact that black Americans come into contact with significantly more people (on average). How can anyone continue to argue that the “vaccines” work at all? This reporting also shatters the idea that black people weren’t vaccinated because they didn’t have access to the COVID jab. Such a notion is absurd, considering the fact that the US government made the COVID immune therapy more widely available and accessible, for free, than probably any other treatment in living memory. It would appear that, rather, black people didn’t take the COVID shot because they are, understandably given the history of race relations in this country, suspicious of the medical and pharmaceutical establishment. Their skepticism has clearly been borne out. Not to mention the fact that Democrats’ assumption that black people wanted the “vaccine” but had it denied to them and simply gave up, rather than the reality that black people on average simply exercised their free individual choice not to take the treatment, is the racism at work here. The Democrats couldn’t fathom the possibility that black people just didn’t want the “vaccine”, that they must have had it withheld from them unfairly and made into victims. Assuming that every person in a racial category is a victim is racist. Acknowledging that different cultures tend—TEND—toward different choices because of different values is not. Once again, the Democrats prove themselves the true racists. 
2022-10-25;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6KL0oy_VHM;authoritarianism;A judge in New York ruled that employees fired for refusing the COVID “vaccine” must be reinstated and awarded back pay because the vaccination requirement was arbitrary and capricious. In his opinion, the judge correctly noted that the “vaccine” requirement under the pretext of stopping the spread was invalid because vaccinated individuals spread COVID as much as the unvaccinated, if not more. He also observed that, if the requirement were truly a matter of public health, then there would be no exceptions for athletes and entertainers, that every single person would be required to get it regardless of occupation. In short, as subscribers to real science have known since the data was published, there is literally no public health basis for a COVID shot mandate, because it doesn’t stop the spread. It says a lot that a judge in one of the most left-leaning states in the country saw the “vaccine” mandates for the tyranny that they were. The landmark ruling opens the door for more such suits and victories against the authoritarian Democrats who forced an ineffective experimental immune therapy on hardworking Americans across the country. 
2022-10-26;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63394664;authoritarianism;The Democrats are so conformist and cowardly that they would rather snap into line with their party and barrel toward nuclear war than go on the record in saying that maybe Biden made a mistake in antagonizing a nuclear-armed state. Any ounce of respect that these dissenting Democrats could have earned is now gone, with interest. This cowardice is the worst trait that any party can exhibit: blind subservience to the party no matter how unhinged it gets. This is what Democrats accused the Republicans of in their support for Trump, despite the fact that there are many “Never Trump” Republicans who remain in the party. It is unthinkable to Democrats that they should ever express the merest hint of criticism. A political climate like that inevitably leads to catastrophe. No one dared criticize the Nazis or the Soviet Communists from within, and these political entities committed the most horrifying atrocities in human history. When Gabbard dared to challenge the Democrat establishment, wanting only to improve the party she had committed herself to for the sake of the American people, she was sidelined and rendered impotent until she finally left the party. Undoubtedly, the erstwhile dissenting Democrats who questioned Biden’s Russia policy were pressured by the party to recant as the midterm elections approached, so as not to diminish their chance of victory. This is yet another data point showing that the Democrats put party over country: they would rather steer the nation toward the abyss to win an election than act as sober and responsible stewards of the nation and take a hit at the polls. 
2022-10-28;https://twitter.com/halalflow/status/1586001778574872577;foreign policy;The Biden administration’s refusal to even talk to its Russian counterparts to avert nuclear war is so alarming that even Obama is criticizing it (though, of course mildly, because the most important thing is Democrats winning in November). Obama recently said something extremely obvious and sensible which his fellow Democrats somehow can’t get through their heads: it’s a bad idea to cut off nearly all communication with another nuclear-armed state you are at risk of open hostilities with. Literally Biden and his party are either so inept or so fanatical that they don’t understand how profoundly dangerous it is to refuse to negotiate a deescalation in a proxy war with a world power. Are leaders like this the kind we want or can afford to have? Does any thinking, non-ideological zealot of a person think this is a good idea? 
2022-10-29;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/29/aoc-2022-midterms-voter-intimidation-dhs-fbi-warning;authoritarianism;Yet another Democrat is attempting to activate their voter base by claiming that a vote for their opponents is treason against the republic, a viewpoint which is itself fascist. Consider this: if the Democrats were on track to win this midterm election, would they still be saying voting Republican is fascist? Of course not. There would be no need. Democrats may or may not sincerely believe the Republicans are fascist, but they would not risk playing with fire in expressing as much if they didn’t have to, as argued here previously. Once you call your enemy an existential threat, you rile up your base so fanatically that they will demand you use any means necessary to destroy your enemy or else accuse of you of capitulating to that enemy. The Democrats only invoke the “Republicans are fascist” rhetoric when they have no other choice, and the more they do so the more desperate they are. Desperate political entities run the risk of making dangerous moves. 
2022-10-29;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1586414791618449408, https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1586418394651193344;authoritarianism;The attack on Pelosi’s husband is full of puzzling details which sure do make it look like something other than a random, legitimate attack. It’s already conspicuously convenient timing that just as the Democrats are ramping up their “the Republicans are destroying democracy” rhetoric, some guy with QAnon on his social media attacks the Democrat Hose Speaker’s spouse but doesn’t kill him despite easily having the chance to. Another fishy detail is that Pelosi’s husband allegedly asked the assailant to use the bathroom, the assailant assented, and Pelosi’s husband used the reprieve to call 911. I dare any Democrat supporter to explain how it is that this attacker was a ruthless ideologically motivated assassin and yet for some reason not only didn’t kill his victim but allowed his victim to go to the bathroom and call 911. And then to make this whole story even stranger, police were reportedly admitted to the house by an “unknown person” to find the assailant and the victim struggling over a weapon. Why didn’t this third person assist Pelosi’s husband in fending off the attacker before letting police enter. It’s almost like this unidentified third person wanted to ensure that police could witness the attack so that Democrats could credibly claim to be the victim. All of this evidence is, of course, inconclusive, but it sure does smell more like a false flag operation than a bona fide home invasion and assault. Can any rational person look at the currently available evidence and conclude otherwise? 
2022-11-01;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/01/interview-fcc-commissioner-says-government-should-ban-tiktok;identity;When Trump made moves to ban TikTok, the Democrats uniformly and mercilessly accused him of racism, but now that Democrats are pursuing the exact same policy no one is criticizing any supposed racism. At least one Senate Democrat had the graciousness to give Trump credit for first proposing the TikTok ban which his party is now slowly embracing. But the Democrats have offered no apology or admission that there was no inherent racism in attempting to ban a software application literally owned by a hostile enemy nation—the race of the people living in that nation have no bearing on the threat its government poses to the US. So because they never retracted their accusation of racism for a policy they now endorse, wouldn’t that make the Democrats racists too? Since the Democrats’ brand is “we’re not racist”, then it’s doubtful they would pursue a policy they explicitly deem to be racist. So the real answer is that they never thought it was a racist policy, but simply called it as such to take shots at Trump. This is yet another data point showing that the Democrats have no moral center and stand for nothing. They will simply utter any slander which helps them, even if it is plainly hypocritical. 
2022-11-01;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1587643399762345984;authoritarianism;The Democrats’ faithful servant (as of this writing), Twitter, is already granting themselves the authority to declare what races were truly won and which ones are still up in the air, and making excuses in case the midterm vote tallying takes extra long for some reason. What capacity does Twitter have to decide which claims of electoral victory are legitimate and which ones are not? The only ones who may determine that are the election officials whose role it is to tally the votes. Furthermore, after Twitter suppressed the Hunter Biden laptop story, which no journalistic outlet has been able to refute with evidence, how is it that they seriously believe they have any credibility in calling the outcome of an election in an unbiased way? So after Twitter acted as an agent of the Democrats, shielding Biden from bad press in the waning days of the 2020 election, they have the audacity to declare that they have the authority to define what a real election win looks like? In a perverse way, though, they de facto do. They can make any declaration they want about a candidate (Republican, of course) not really winning, then a journalist can point to it as evidence that the declaration of victory was illegitimate, and then the Democrats will point to that supposedly independent journalist as evidence for why they need to use the power of the federal government to oppose any such Republican candidates. 
2022-11-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1587636921085353984, https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1587636921085353984;authoritarianism;The Biden administration is investigating Twitter just days after Musk’s purchase went through, to supposedly combat the national security risk posed by foreign influence. As the Twitter user who posted this aptly points out, “everybody knows exactly why this is happening”. Does any thinking person seriously believe that this is some big coincidence? Historically, it sure didn’t look like the national security implications of Twitter’s ownership concerned the US government (under Democrats or Republicans). Neither Obama nor Biden expressed any concern with the fact that a Saudi prince wqs the second-largest shareholder. The Saudi government brutally oppresses its own people and funds terrorism. The Biden administration certainly isn’t concerned about foreign influence, since Hunter Biden took millions from Ukraine and China. So this pretense that suddenly Biden cares about who owns Twitter is unconvincing, to say the very least. So, truly, everybody DOES know why this is happening. And to apply the trusty partisan bias heuristic yet again, consider this: imagine if Twitter was cozy with the Republicans, suppressing unflattering media pieces on Trump and censoring left-wing political speech, a left-leaning billionaire bought Twitter, and then Trump’s government announced they were going to investigate the purchase. The left would be literally be rioting in the streets calling for Trump’s head. But somehow, with reality playing out pro-Democrat, we’re just supposed to accept that this is reasonable and unbiased? This is Democrat hypocrisy as glaring as it gets. 
2022-11-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1587635786899390465;authoritarianism;A sitting US senate Democrat has decreed that free speech doesn’t apply to challenging Democrats’ policies and integrity. Unless by “Free speech does not include spreading misinformation to downplay political violence” he meant the George Floyd rioters’ claim that police officers’ lethal negligence was cold-blooded racism in spite of body cam footage of earlier in police interaction with Floyd that showed officers being very courteous but firm with him. Or if he meant Antifa’s various outlandish left-wing claims that they make before setting federal courthouses on fire and starting firefights in downtown Portland. Or if he meant the convicted violent pedophiles at the BLM riot in Kenosha who assaulted an underage boy. If he meant those things, as well as right-leaning rhetoric that excuses political violence, then he would be taking a stand against political violence-inflaming speech in general. But since he probably didn’t intend to include those few incidents, I submit to you again that he meant speech that challenges Democrats. And even if somehow he intended an evenhanded, nonpartisan condemnation of political violence—he doesn’t, because Antifa operates in his state with impunity, but let’s pretend—that still doesn’t mean that he gets to dictate what is protected by the First Amendment, and it definitely doesn’t limit political speech. In fact, the Supreme Court has found that political speech is specifically not limited in any way. This is supported by, among many other cases, Texas v. Johnson. 
2022-11-02;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/02/biden-capitol-hill-speech-democracy;authoritarianism;As with all the Democrats’ previous warnings on the fate of democracy in the upcoming election, they all indicate that the Democrats know they’re losing and want to avert defeat by claiming that a vote for their opponents is a vote to kill democracy. What’s worse about this particular incarnation of this authoritarian tactic—delegitimizing a vote for any other viable party but their own—is that Biden is using his privileged access to government facilities to do so. It’s illegal to film oneself within a government facilty as part of an election campaign, an offense Obama was criticized for. How is this any different? In fact, it’s far more egregious because Biden is not using the Capitol Building to simply say “vote for me” or “vote for my party”, but to instead say “voting for the Republicans (the only other major party that can gain a serious presence in federal, state, and municipal governments across the country) is fascist”. To apply the effective heuristic, imagine if Trump had spoken in Congress in 2018 and said “we have a serious threat to democracy in this election, so make sure you vote for the right party”? The Democrats and their obedient attack dogs in the media would have gone nuclear. But the Democrats do it and we’re all supposed to accept the rhetorical prelude to banning the Republican party as a fair and unbiased assessment by wise and impartial leaders? 
2022-11-02;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/03/biden-speech-trump-pelosi-midterms;authoritarianism;Continuing down the road toward outlawing the Republican party, Biden declared that the attack on Pelosi’s husband was Trump’s fault. At no point did Trump instruct Americans to attack Democrats or their families. In fact, his challenge to the 2020 election is one he has pursued on legal and electoral grounds, not through political violence. He has said that at this point, his legal options exhausted, he would simply run again and win. The attacker in this case, which Biden pinned on Trump, wasn’t even American, and not even in the US legally, so what stake does he have in supposedly heeding some coded Trump instruction to attack Democrats? If we really want to talk about supporting political violence, then what about when Maxine Waters strongly hinted that, if Laquan McDonald’s killer wasn’t found guilty, protesters should physically attack him. So how come Biden didn’t link her words to attacks on Republicans? Or how come he didn’t link radical abortion activists’ words to attempted assassinations of Supreme Court justices? In fact, there has been much more dangerous violence, many more close calls, coming from the left against the right than the other way around. 
2022-11-02;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/02/biden-strategic-petroleum-reserve-oil-levels;economy;Biden has reduced the Strategic Petroleum Reserve down to the lowest level it has been at in 40 years. The last few presidents in both parties have drawn from this reserve to reduce gas prices, but for Biden to do so to such a staggering degree is unconscionable and extremely reckless. His party’s economic policies are so abysmal that there is essentially no pulling out of the economic nose dive before the midterms. And yet in spite of this, Biden still attempted to use the US’s taxpayer-funded national security stockpile to get his party reelected. He is dipping into emergency petroleum for wartime just so that his party wins. If Trump handed out oil barrels as freely as Biden, the Democrats would never let him hear the end of it. Let this be a reminder that the Democrats are for party above country, always. They accuse the Republicans of this relentlessly, and that’s exactly how you know that it is more true of Democrats than their rival party. 
2022-11-03;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/03/david-depape-pelosi-suspect-canada-immigration;immigration;Pelosi’s husband’s attacker is an illegal immigrant, finally hitting Democrats with the consequences of their open border policies. Democrats love to talk about immigration as though everyone who comes to the US legally is a totally upstanding person who simply can’t afford to wait in line and go through the immigration process legally. This is what happens when you make that assumption. If one is an immigrant and one is a law-abiding person, what do they have to hide by circumventing the legal immigration process? On the other hand, why would one dodge legal immigration procedure UNLESS they had something to hide that would disqualify them? This is simpl logic that a 9-year-old can understand, and yet this comes as a surprise to Democrats. Now they’re suffering the consequences of just assuming anyone who comes here is an innocent, harmless person. If they had simply enforced immigration law, the people who are too dangerous to have come here legally would get promptly deported. Violent incidents like this will keep happening until the Democrats learn this simple lesson. 
2022-11-03;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1588310038459785216;authoritarianism;New reporting has emerged showing that DHS has engaged in full-on thought policing by directing social media which online speech to censor. It would be one thing if social media, completely independent of any input from the government, decided to “moderate” content in line with their clearly published “community standards”. But it is a completely different matter for the government to directly instruct social media to censor speech online. This is, as the federal courts have ruled in multiple cases, unconstitutional, a violation of the First Amendment. And of course, the censorship conveniently covers all the issues on which the Democrats are challenged for their catastrophically failed policies. Any challenge to Democrat COVID policies which destroyed American small businesses and the economy with it, Democrat policies imposing neo-racism under the guise of “racial justice”, Democrat policies to leave billions of dollars worth of equipment to terrorists in Afghanistan, and Democrat policies to risk nuclear war so they can defend a country that funnels millions of dollars to the Bidens from that country’s corrupt oligarchs, is suppressed by the federal government as “disinformation”. All the Democrats’ lies, though, are of course perfectly permissible, protected by the First Amendment, and left completely undisturbed by the DHS. The Democrat lie that the COVID “vaccines” stop transmission (they absolutely fail to do so), the Democrat lie that every American is racist (this is obviously preposterous on its face), the Democrat lie that the exit from Afghanistan was smooth (there’s nothing smooth about giving terrorists billions in top-tier military hardware), and the Democrat lie that Russia attacked Ukraine completely unprovoked (Russia told the West not to make Ukraine pro-Western or else they’d attack, and the West did anyway) are all allowed by DHS to flourish online... because that’s just people exercising their free speech, apparently. So for the Democrats, any lie they utter is free speech, while any uncomfortable truth the Republicans express is dangerous misinformation that cannot be allowed to reach the American people. It is hard to find more glaring examples of authoritarianism: using the power of the federal government to enforce your warped worldview over the truth put forward by one’s opponents. In fact censorship proves the censor’s lies: why would one need to censor if one has the truth on one’s side? I dare anyone to look all this evidence in the face and still argue that the Democrats aren’t the true authoritarians.
2022-11-05;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/05/deaths-alcohol-spiked-pandemic;COVID;Death from alcohol rose by 26% in the US due to COVID lockdowns, despite Democrats’ insistence that the lockdown saved lives. It is already established that the lockdowns, as imposed by the Democrats, only reduced COVID deaths by 0.5%. This figure is so minuscule that the corresponding 26% increase in alcohol-related deaths likely more than offsets the reduced mortality. And this is only the spike in alcohol-related deaths—it doesn’t even count all the other “deaths of despair” that the lockdowns caused to spike like suicides and drug overdoses. Insisting that these are insignificant and that the lockdowns worked is an odd line for a party that claims to value mental health to take. But then again, that’s because the Democrats never really cared about mental health. If they did, then the rate of mental illness wouldn’t be so much higher among Democrats than Republicans. It’s funny how negative social dynamic that the Democrats claim to fight against is more acute in every Democrat-heavy demographic group: racially correlated poverty in multi-generationally Democrat-controlled cities, racism committed by the left, sexual harassment on Democrats’ staffs, mental illness among Democrats, gun crime in Democrat gun-controlled cities and states, etc. How is it that anyone who legitimately cares about these issues doesn’t notice that the Democrats have utterly failed to address any of them? When will people finally understand that the Democrat cure is worse than the disease? 
2022-11-04;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1588905814676606976;authoritarianism;NBC reported that Pelosi answered the door when police showed up, did not “declare an emergency” was taking place, and walked back into the house toward the attacker. How can any rational person consider this fact and still argue that this is consistent with a legitimate, unstaged attack? Anyone over the age of 9 should be able to tell you that this doesn’t seem like the behavior of the victim of a real attack. Furthermore, how is it not suspicious that NBC took down this video report without any explanation? News media sometimes gets stories wrong, but when they do they issue a correction or retraction in order to preserve their credibility. Especially since the overwhelming majority of journalists willingly serve the Democrats’ every whim, you would think that NBC would eagerly retract this story if it was wrong, so that they could continue to enable the Democrats’ victimhood status. Instead, NBC pulled the video with no notice of any kind, as if they were hoping no one would catch it. Is that the behavior of a news outlet pursuing the truth at all costs, wherever it leads, for the good of the American public? That was rhetorical, because the answer is obviously not. Though not conclusive, this is enough circumstantial evidence to shift the burden of proof onto those who claim this was a legitimate attack. We still don’t know for sure, but there is now way more that is inconsistent with such an incident than consistent. Of course, by what I’m sure we are supposed to believe is a coincidence, this attack happened so close to the midterm election that we won’t know the truth before the votes are all cast. Interesting timing, isn’t it? 
2022-11-04;https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciac807/6795268?login=false;COVID;A new study shows that COVID, which pharmaceutical giants and public health officials assured us could ONLY be treated with experimental mRNA immune therapy, is easily treatable by taking twice-daily doses of zinc. Again, there were doctors on the frontline of the pandemic desperate to treat patients who, before there was a COVID shot, resorted to creative treatments to keep people alive. Some of these treatments held promise, but required further study. But when these doctors asked the CDC to follow up on treatments such as ivermectin and zinc, the CDC flatly refused. How is this the behavior of a rational, responsible institution dedicated to public safety? What public health objectives are met by deliberately refusing to assess the viability of a cheap and highly available treatment to a pandemic claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands? Not only have pharma megacompanies profited from experimental COVID shots, but also from COVID pills (also of doubtful effectiveness). And yet somehow years later we learn there is an extremely cheap and accessible alternative? Are we really supposed to believe that this is 100% coincidental? Everyone in the CDC and the FDA who shut down follow-up studies on repurposing drugs like ivermectin and zinc should be investigated for any financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry and, if found to have such ties, imprisoned for the rest of their natural lives. 
2022-11-05;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/05/biden-twitter-spews-lies-elon-musk;authoritarianism;The Democrat smear campaign against Twitter continues as the final days before the midterm election wind down. Biden has now stated that Twitter “spews lies”. Interesting that he wasn’t making any such pointed accusations when Twitter suppressed a true unflattering story about his son just days before he was elected president, isn’t it? How is suppressing a truth that is of vital public interest—the moral character of a presidential candidate’s family—different from spreading a lie? This just shows that the Democrats have no integrity or ethical foundation of any kind. They cover for lies that benefit them and denounce any statement, true or false, that criticizes them. 
2022-11-06;https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-twitter-fact-checks-biden-over-gas-price;economy;Now that Twitter is no longer owned by the Democrats’ faithful servants, the platform is finally giving Democrats a taste of the fact-checking they love imposing on everyone else so much. When Biden tweeted about bringing gas prices down to the “most common” price of $3.19, Twitter fact-checkers correctly pointed out that this figure (the statistical mode) is not the same as the average gas price (the statistical mean). Any high school math student should be able to tell you that the mean price, which Biden conveniently omitted, is far more indicative of the current state of gas prices than the mode price he cited. Did Biden lie? Technically, no, since there is no reason that that mode figure could not be derived from the data. It is, however, misleading, which is why it was used instead of the average gas price. I wonder if Democrats still appreciate Twitter’s effort at fact-checking, especially since Biden just accused Twitter of allowing too many lies to circulate. Something tells me this is something they’d be OK with the fact-checkers skipping over. If Democrats want to play the fact-checking game, they should be prepared to face the consequences. 
2022-11-06;http://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-fbi-investigating-suspicious-powder-mailed-to-kari-lakes-office;authoritarianism;As the Democrats blame the entire Republican party for suspiciously timed attacks on their politicians’ families, the much more serious violence against Republican politicians continues. A white powder was sent to the home of Republican candidate Kari Lake. This is the latest in a string of violent threats to Republicans over the last few years, including attempts to assassinate conservative Supreme Court justices and a shooting of Republican members of Congress. If one attack on a Democrat’s family, possibly random or quite possibly staged, is enough to condemn the entire Republican party as advocating violence against the Democrats, then how are the Republicans not justified in calling the Democrats jackboot authoritarians who condone political violence against THEIR opponents? It is laughably common for the Democrats to condemn the Republicans for lesser offenses than the ones they themselves commit. Or at least, it would be laughable if they double-standard they were playing with wasn’t so frighteningly dangerous. This particular double-standard is straight out of the extreme left’s playbook: they are allowed to engage in political violence as they see fit, but if they can frame their opponents as doing so, then it authorizes them to eradicate that opposition from the political arena. 
2022-11-06;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/06/rnc-chair-ronna-mcdaniel-2022-midterm-election;elections;The chair of the Republican Party declared what should be an uncontroversial assumption that the Democrats insisted could not be assumed: that the Republicans would respect the midterm election outcome as long as the election is conducted transparently and they are allowed to pursue election challenges through the court system as the law allows. The Democrats have been trying to convince the electorate that the Republicans are out to destroy democracy, but what can be more democratic than both vowing respect for the outcome AND affirming the right to challenge elections peacefully in the courts? At most, the Democrats can only be said to respect the first of these, but not the second. Recall how the Democrats vilified the Republicans for pursuing election challenges via the law in 2020, as is EVERY candidate’s right. So really, who respects democracy less, the party that doesn’t believe elections should be verified or challenged (Democrats) or the one that respects the vote after challenges reach their conclusion (Republicans)? 
2022-11-06;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/06/james-clyburn-democrats-2022-midterms-democracy;authoritarianism;Yet another Democrat has declared that America only has a democracy if the Democrats win. This is the exact same rhetoric as authoritarian one-party states like China: they claim to have democracy as long as their party is the one that wins, that any other party winning shatters said “democracy”. This is as authoritarian as any statement can possibly get, because it debases the very soul of democracy. Democracy is only democratic if any challenger is allowed to win if they receive enough votes. The Democrats have now fully and nakedly embraced the language of tyrants the world over: they are every bit the authoritarians as the Chinese Communist Party, Putin’s Russian political faction, the North Korean communists, and the Iranian religious hardliners, among many others. What business do Democrats have of telling anyone what constitutes democracy? 
2022-11-07;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/07/democrats-midterm-extreme-warning-third-way;authoritarianism;Even fellow Democrats are now worried that their party is so extreme that it’s repelling moderate voters. It’s stunning that it took Democrats this long to realize that destroying the economy for negligible reduction in pandemic deaths, forcing Americans under penalty of lost jobs to get an experimental gene therapy, letting criminals run free in every major American city, and censoring anyone who dares criticize them might be seen as extreme to a normal, rational person. And that is just a small taste of the extremism they have wrought—this corner of the Internet has warned of far more authoritarian abuses and staggering incomptencies. But this leftward radicalization of the Democrat party as been going full speed ahead since at least the end of the Obama presidency, and only now they’re seeing it. If one had to guess, it’s probably because the party has sidelined, ejected, or driven away all the sensible figures in their party, like Gabbard. They will not learn this lesson. They didn’t learn it when Trump won, they didn’t learn it Gabbard left the party, and they won’t get it when they lose in the midterms. Every lesson they don’t learn will not only allow but encourage them to continue radicalizing. The Democrats have become a cult so convinced of its own righteousness that it takes criticism and resistance as a signal to double down and get more extreme. 
2022-11-08;https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-awarded-bottomless-pinocchio-by-washington-post-for-false-and-misleading-statements-ahead-of-midterms;authoritarianism;Biden is such a rampant liar that even the Washington Post, which never fails to go to bat for the Democrats when they need it most, finds his lies egregious. Wasn’t Biden the one who said he would restore truth to the White House where Trump was a shameful liar? Isn’t that the very definition of gaslighting, which the Democrats swear they never do (which is now gaslighting about gaslighting)? Isn’t Biden the one keeps talking about how dangerous “misinformation” is to democracy (a talking point he used as recently as last week)? So what’s his excuse? All politicians lie. Trump certainly did. But he also never claimed to be this unwavering beacon of truth. The Democrats have this peculiar and audacious habit of claiming to be so much better than their opponents in a certain regard, only to slink around and try to get away with being MORE blameworthy in that same regard. At this point, there are perpetually good odds that whatever the Democrats accuse the Republicans, the Democrats have also done but worse. 
2022-11-09;http://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-biden-says-elon-musk-worth-being-looked-at-as-a-threat-to-national-security;authoritarianism;Biden himself has doubled down on the words of his administration’s underlings indicating that he would look into Musk’s purchase of Twitter, even though they raised no objections in the months between Musk’s announcements and the deal closing. As was aptly put by a commentator previously, every single rational person knows exactly what this is all about. This is not because Biden sincerely cares who runs social media companies. If it was, he would have banned TikTok 2 years ago, and he would have spent his time in the Obama White House investigating all the Saudi and Chinese money invested in American tech companies. But he did none of that. He waited until someone who announced he’d oppose the censorship he swears his party doesn’t do assumes control of Twitter and THEN he investigates Twitter. Does Biden not realize how guilty this makes him and his party look? They claim they don’t censor anyone on Twitter, and then when a new Twitter owner comes along and says censorship on the platform is over, they investigate that new owner. And in doing so, Biden’s response to opposition to his authoritarianism is more authoritarianism. Imagine if this happened in Russia. Putin claims he doesn’t censor anyone. So now imagine if Navalny bought Russian Twitter promising to end censorship and then Putin investigated Navalny. Biden would drop everything to give a statement about how that is tyranny and America won’t let it go unpunished. Yet Biden is doing exactly what he would condemn among our enemies (and rightly so). With the Democrats, there is no tyranny they aren’t willing to inflict on their opponents if they can get away with it, and there is no moral objectivity. There is only what they can use as a cudgel against their opponents, and what they will simultaneously do and deny when they get caught doing it. Are these the kind of authoritarian leaders you can afford to live under? 
2022-11-10;http://thepostmillennial.com/nbc-pundits-celebrate-sexist-statement-that-lauren-boebert-should-go-into-sex-work-if-she-loses-congressional-seat;identity;Pundits on NBC, which is basically the media arm of the Democrats, freely made a sexist remark about a Republican woman that they would mercilessly condemn if made about a Democrat woman. The pundits stated with glee that if Boebert lost her reelection, she should essentially become a sex worker. Typically, the left would see such a remark as sexist, because it suggests that all a woman is good for is sex. They’re implying that Boebert couldn’t get any other paying job, like being a an entrepreneur, a corporate executive, a news media figure, or any number of other jobs the left usually insists to the hilt that women are capable of. All she would have to fall back on, these NBC “journalists” suggest, is selling her body. This is yet another data point that the Democrats believe in nothing. They don’t care about women, because when the mask comes off they think of women as the very sex objects they deny reducing women to. So next time the Democrats say they care about women so much (probably in the context of abortion), think about that. And while you’re at it, think about how Democrats are OK with biological males who declare themselves “women” obliterating biological females in athletics and raping biological females in women’s prisons. In fact, they’re so OK with these things that if even a woman on the left calls them into question the Democrats will call that left-leaning woman a bigot and make sure she never works again. That’s EXACTLY how much Democrats care about women. 
2022-11-10;https://thepostmillennial.com/watch-ana-navarro-says-ron-desantis-won-by-gaming-the-system;authoritarianism;Doing exactly what they swore the Republicans would do, Democrats claim that their loss in Florida was because DeSantis cheated. Didn’t the Democrats say that anyone who made accusations of cheating was anti-democracy and is a danger to the nation? How are these Democrats not being condemned by their fellow party members for unraveling the fabric of democracy? Oh, that’s right, because the Democrats don’t stand for anything. Any standards they profess to be sacred are only applied to their opponents. Democrats themselves are allowed a free pass to transgress even the most sacred norms of our republic. Democrats think nothing of taking away Americans’ free speech rights, forcing an experimental medical treatment on them, and refusing to accept the results of elections they themselves claim to have secured. But if a Republican even contemplated any of these things, then the Democrats are justified in destroying their career by any means necessary. The Democrats have neither integrity nor shame. They are the lowliest authoritarian scum our country has ever concentrated in one place because they not only embrace authoritarianism, but gaslight us and then accuse their opponents of being the authoritarians. 
2022-11-10;https://thepostmillennial.com/portland-antifa-member-who-advocates-for-political-violence-works-for-far-left-group-hired-by-city-to-train-cops;authoritarianism;The city of Portland has hired a left-wing terrorist group whose members publicly advocate violence to train the city’s police. Wasn’t the entire reason for the left’s radical activism that the police are supposedly too violent? More importantly, how does a group that tried to set federal property on fire and wrested control of part of the city from the legal government thereof have any right to train that city’s police? How is such a group even remotely welcome in the city government? This group flagrantly broke some of the most serious laws on the books in the city of Portland, the state of Oregon, and the entire United States. Anitfa is the very definition of terrorists: entities which use violence to seek some political outcome. So how are domestic leftist terrorists not only un-antagonized by the police but welcomed in to train them? I dare anyone to claim that Democrats oppose domestic terrorism when Democrats literally let terrorists train cops. The Democrats just oppose the right, plain and simple. The Democrats pursue nonviolent right-leaning groups far less radical than Antifa while inviting Antifa into their police departments. If you want a picture of fascism, look no further than Portland Democrats... and other cities’ Democrats soon to follow, no doubt. The Democrats’ embrace of extremist street thugs on their side of the political spectrum is the exact same playbook the Nazis ran as they ascended power in Germany: government officials worked with their jackboot street enforcers to intimidate their opponents. This is 100 times worse than any supposed fascism the Republicans have supposedly exhibited. 
2022-11-11;https://thepostmillennial.com/new-mall-planned-in-minneapolis-for-prioritizing-non-white-business-owners;identity;Democrats are now practicing the very redlining they claim to be against, all in the name of “racial justice” of course. A pro-Democrat real estate developer is planning to open a mall in Minneapolis that will actively oppose the opening of businesses owned by white Americans. How is this not redlining but applied to a different racial group? If someone opened a mall that kept non-whites from operating their businesses there, everyone would (rightly) be outraged. But yet the left is doing exactly that, just not to non-whites, and has the audacity to claim this isn’t only not racist but “racial justice”. Not only that, but setting up a dedicated space for non-white business owners is also racist against the very people it tries to help, because what it implies is that non-whites can’t succeed unless certain groups are excluded from competing with them. This move literally sets property aside that only a much smaller subset of the population of Minneapolis has access to. The real estate developer is, by his actions, essentially saying “you non-whites can’t compete against whites on a level-playing field, so I have to exclude them in order for you to have a chance”. I invite any leftist to explain how this isn’t racist against the very people it claims to defend. But this is classic Democrat: anything they claim to be against they are even more strongly for, with racism at the top of the list. The Democrats were racist during the Civil War, they were racist during the Civil Rights era, and they took their racism and repackaged it as “anti-racism” today. And Democrats’ policies ensure that non-whites are exactly the victims they insist they are, and then claim to have the only solution to the problem they created. There is no more racist party than the Democrats. 
2022-11-11;http://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-joe-biden-plans-to-extend-covid-health-emergency-to-april-2023-reports;authoritarianism;Despite literally declaring that the pandemic was over, Biden is moving to extend his COVID-related emergency powers. Strange that he needs more emergency powers for an emergency he said was over, don’t you think? How is this not authoritarian? There is not a shred of doubt that if Trump did this, it would be all over the news, and the Democrats would start a whole new impeachment proceeding. At their core, the Democrats are tyrants, and they will take any shred of power they can under any pretext. 
2022-11-13;https://thepostmillennial.com/pfizer-moderna-investigate-links-between-covid-vaccine-and-myocarditis;COVID;After years of the COVID “vaccines” being on the market accompanied by constant dismissal of concerns of myocarditis, Pfizer and Moderna are now investigating the potential risk of myocarditis these therapies pose. For the last nearly 2 years, public health officials and drug manufacturer spokespeople insisted that talk of the risk of myocarditis was misinformation, the ramblings of crazed conspiracy theorists. But if such claims were totally crackpot, why is it that these companies are now seriously concerned with the possibility that their COVID drugs can lead to myocarditis? And if the “vaccines” were as thoroughly tested as they claimed, how is it possible that they didn’t have any idea of these potential side-effects until now? Does it have anything to do with their attempt to hide their testing data from the public for decades? And of course, no one has issued so much as an admission of error for dismissing concerns of myocarditis, much less an apology for vilifying those who were simply concerned with peoples’ health. But again, either the drug companies knew that myocarditis was a possible side-effect and intentionally withheld this information, or they are so staggeringly inept that they had no idea. Either way, how are pharma companies entities that people can even remotely trust at this point? And as a result, how is it that the government has any businesses coercing us into consume these companies’ products?
2022-11-14;https://thepostmillennial.com/new-york-family-of-woman-slain-by-angry-ex-moves-to-sue-state-over-cashless-bail-laws;law enforcement;Once again, a Democrat “anti-racist” policy, this time “bail reform” (i.e. eliminating bail and letting even those charged with a violent crime roam free) is more racist by their own definition of racism. For the Democrats, any social dynamic that has outcomes that are distributed across races in a disproportionate way (not to scale with the race’s proportion to the overall US population) is racist. The data clearly indicates that African-Americans are disproportionately the victims of violent crime. So when a policy allows violent criminals back on the street before their trial, if they re-offend, they are more likely to victimize black Americans. This is exactly what is playing out: violent criminals let out without bail, on a policy predicated on helping black people, are running loose and injuring and killing black people. None of this is saying that all who are let out without bail are violent. But some are. And those few are enough to destroy innocent lives. But the Democrats don’t seem to care that those lives are overwhelmingly black. I dare Democrats to explain how this isn’t racist. 
2022-11-14;https://thepostmillennial.com/nbc-news-tells-parents-to-vaccinate-their-kids-and-shun-the-unvaccinated-over-the-holidays;COVID;Even though it has been well-established for a year now that the COVID “vaccine” does not in any way stop transmission and never did against any variant, NBC news is still spreading the lie that you can keep someone (in this case a child) from contracting COVID by avoiding the unvaccinated. This epidemiological reality is the only conclusion that can be reached from a review of the data. To say otherwise is nothing other than a lie. Why is a major media outlet continuing to spread misinformation? And how dare they claim that they have the right to combat misinformation, dictating which views deserve to be expressed and which must be suppressed for the public good? Either NBC is failing spectacularly in their role as journalists, pursuing and stating the truth to the public, or they don’t care what the truth is and instead serve the agenda of a group that has a vested interest in coercing as many people to vaccinate for COVID as possible. And which group would that be, that is hell-bent on getting everyone to take an experimental drug which, at best, reduces COVID symptoms until a year goes by and the virus mutates away from the mRNA pattern in the drug? Oh, that’s right, the Democrats, the same Democrats that collectively own millions in Pfizer and Moderna stock. The same Democrats who are trying to convince as many children as possible to become lifelong pharma customers by transitioning genders and taking hormone supplements, which would drive their millions in pharma stock even higher. Americans would really like to hear how it is NBC can justify lying about a topic which we all agree is vital to hear the truth about. 
2022-11-15;https://thepostmillennial.com/philadelphia-hires-citizens-to-do-police-work-due-to-staffing-shortages;law enforcement;Philadelphia is so low on police that they are hiring ordinary citizens to pick up some law enforcement functions. If the Democrats are so tough on crime, how come every major Democrat-controlled city can’t find enough cops to hit the minimum level to keep the city safe, while suburbs and small towns are not having this same problem (at least not to the same degree)? Are we just supposed to believe that it’s a coincidence that the Democrats demonized police, began partially dismantling their police forces, shut down everyone’s business to accomplish statistically insignificant reductions in pandemic deaths, and then crime spiked the most it’s ever increased in a single year in America? I really want to hear the Democrats’ alternative explanation for why every city they control is descending into lawlessness and violence. 
2022-11-16;https://thepostmillennial.com/senate-votes-to-end-covid-public-health-emergency-biden-threatens-to-veto-action;authoritarianism;Biden is continuing to insist on the need for emergency powers to fight COVID even though a sizable contingent of his own party in the Senate is against it. Why does he need this power when he himself said the pandemic is over? And why is he willing to fight much of his own party and veto a vote that is close to the veto override threshold? Imagine if Trump did this. The media and the Democrats would be having a meltdown about Trump being a fascist. Yet when Biden does this, he endures no criticism. 
2022-11-16;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/15/ftz-crypto-bankman-fried-democrats-midterms-campaigns;corruption;The shady businessman behind the spectacularly imploding FTX crypto exchange used his company to funnel more than $27 million to the Democrats, making him the largest single donor to the Democrats after Soros. Interesting that the Democrats seem to like to pal around with sleazy characters like Bankman-Fried, and then turn around and say how Republicans love “dark money”. The Democrats also really criticized super PACs about 10 years ago but seem pretty comfortable with them now that they leverage them to way out-fundraise their opponents (most of the time). Also, isn’t the Democrat position on crypto that it’s bad because it facilitates anonymous transactions (which of course means that it allows people to donate to causes they don’t like) and generates an immense amount of pollution? So why is it that they had no problem taking so much money from not just a crypto tycoon but one who is such an apparently shameless fraudster?
2022-11-16;https://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/body-cam-video-paul-pelosi-attack/3076235/;authoritarianism;A local San Francisco news station is reporting that police body camera footage confirms that Paul Pelosi is indeed the individual who opened the door to his home for police, during an attack where he supposedly had to fight for his life. Again, how is it that Pelosi’s attacker allowed him to open the door to his house for law enforcement if the attacker was in a position to injure him using a blunt object? How can an attacker go from physically assaulting a victim to letting that victim admit police into the scene of the altercation? This claim was initially dismissed by the left as fabricated, but it appears to be very likely true. Those who insist that this attack was authentic and politically motivated, and not apolitical or staged, have a lot of explaining to do. Again, the evidence against the authenticity of this attack is circumstantial, but the evidence (circumstantial or otherwise) in favor of it is non-existent. 
2022-11-17;https://twitter.com/MattWolking/status/1593298161317076995;authoritarianism;The Democrat nominated to take over the House Democrat leadership for Pelosi denied multiple elections in which Republicans won and rejects the legitimacy of the Supreme Court, yet somehow isn’t condemned by the “guardian of democracy” Democrats. As should be crystal clear to anyone even remotely paying attention, the Democrats are allowed to do anything they want, even if they criticize Republicans for doing the exact same thing. It’s alright for Democrats to reject election results or an entire branch of the federal government, but the minute the Republicans take issue with one election the Democrats accuse them and anyone who votes for them of being fascists. The Democrats stand for nothing. They are so devoid of morals that it’s a good bet that whatever they accuse Republicans of, they do on an even grander scale. 
2022-11-17;https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/san-francisco-launches-transgender-guaranteed-income-program/;identity;The Democrats claim they aren’t encouraging people to become trans, yet at the same time hand out free money to people for being trans. They claim that the money is to support people in need, but far more of the needy are not trans than trans. The Democrats are always keen to help their preferred groups first and leave everyone else behind, and are especially interested in increasing the size of their preferred groups... and their dependency on the Democrats, of course. Imagine this: a person in need of assistance is denied every other social program that might help them. Especially since the left has made it clear that trans is something you instantly become as soon as you declare it, why wouldn’t that person just become trans to tap into one more potential source of assistance? Some percentage of these people will then actually continue on to become trans, because people are malleable. The Democrats doling out this cash will obviously seek to validate that the applicant is indeed trans. Those who fake something for too long truly become what they previously pretended. And what do Democrats get out of there being more trans people? The Democrats own tons of pharmaceutical stock, so by giving money to trans people, they get to use taxpayer dollars to buy hormone therapies from the companies they own stock in, thus raising the stock price and becoming wealthier. It’s all very transparent, simple, and unethical. If Democrats really cared about those who claim to be trans, they’d help these people get the mental health resources they need instead of ignoring their underlying mental health needs and pushing patients to medically transition. So again, like with every Democrat social program, this is all about making more people permanently dependent on them. They don’t care of these vulnerable people live or die. 
2022-11-17;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-63671943;national security;The FBI under Biden knew there are secret Chinese “police stations” in the middle of American cities, a flagrant affront to US territorial sovereignty, and just let them continue operating. China is a hostile enemy nation. China wants to destroy, subsume, and dominate our allies. And if given chance, China would gladly destroy the United States. The US and China only coexist uneasily and out of reluctant mutual necessity. And yet with all of this well-understood by the average American, the top counterintelligence body of our nation knowingly allowed Chinese agents to act against the interests of the United States on its own soil. How is this anything other than treason on the part of every FBI agent who knew this and did nothing? And how is this not treasonous on the part of every Biden administration official who knew the FBI’s findings and did nothing? The entire administration is dangerously cavalier about letting our enemies plot against us, and extend their oppressive totalitarian legal regime into US territory, right under our noses. But then again, the Chinese Communist Party and the US Democratic Party both agree that dissent against them should be opposed by the state, so perhaps they are on friendly terms after all. Every American is owed an explanation from the Biden administration as to how it is even remotely acceptable to let the Chinese government operate clandestinely in our nation. 
2022-11-17;https://www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/vaccine-trials-should-monitor-menstrual-changes-researchers-say-rcna57520;COVID;Nearly 2 years after the COVID “vaccines” first rolled out to the general public with vehement assurances that they were thoroughly tested and safe, the pharma companies are admitting that they didn’t monitor the drug’s effect on menstruation. In fact, the COVID “vaccines’” manufacturers specifically denied that there were any adverse effects on women’s reproductive health, which we now know had no basis in data—it was purely an unsubstantiated claim by manufacturers. How is it that anyone can stand up and defend these companies anymore when they are this negligent (as to fail to monitor such a basic and critical area of women’s health) and this willing to lie to cover up their negligence? And how is it that anyone can dare condemn those who are skeptical of the COVID shot manufacturers’ claims of safety? It is clear that these pharma companies took an alarmingly lax (to say the very least) attitude toward testing their drugs. And why wouldn’t they when people were desperate to protect themselves from a new contagion and the government was willing to cut corners to allow their drugs to market in record time? All of this was easily deduced from simple reasoning a year ago, yet only now is the evidence confirming this deduction emerging, after demonization and “vaccine” mandates.
2022-11-17;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1593387236187262976;authoritarianism ;Conveniently right after the midterm election was over, Biden’s Justice Department admitted that none of the documents Trump had at Mar-A-Lago posed any risk to US national security. In other words, the raid on Trump’s home had no law enforcement justification. The raid was purely utilizing the FBI as a political instrument of the Democrats, further destroying the public image of a political opponent to ensure that his party lost to the Democrats in the midterm election. How is this not the very essence of authoritarianism? If Trump used the FBI to go after Clinton—whose unauthorized retention of classified information, in digital form on an unsecured personal network that our enemies could easily hack into, was much more detrimental to the nation than any paper documents Trump improperly kept— the Democrats and all their supporters would be in the streets beating cops to death and burning buildings to the ground. Yet we are supposed to tolerate the Democrats unleashing armed federal agents on their opponents as fair and just? It is clear that the Democrats believe they have the right to wield the state to punish their political opponents, which is exactly what Erdogan does in Turkey, what Putin does in Russia, what the Saudi royals do in Saudi Arabia, and what the CCP does in China. Under the Democrats, America is in actual practice no more free than any of those places. 
2022-11-18;https://thepostmillennial.com/lawyer-who-firebombed-nypd-cruiser-sentenced-to-15-months-after-biden-admin-intervention;authoritarianism;The Biden administration went out of its way to convince a judge to lower the sentence of a rioter who set a police car on fire from the 10-year minimum down to 15 months. The rioter was convicted of throwing a molotov cocktail at a police cruiser in New York during the George Floyd riots. If Biden supports law enforcement, why is he going easy on people who had no qualms with taking the lives of law enforcement officers? How can any of the Democrats dare to claim that they support law enforcement if this is how they handle violence against law enforcement? The signal this sends is that, if you riot for the Democrats’ cause, they’ll back you up and make sure you suffer the minimum possible consequences. The clear implication is that the Democrats tolerate rioting if it serves their purposes, and that they are encouraging their supporters to riot whenever they are moved to do so. Never mind that the riot resulted in dozens of deaths, hundreds of injuries, and the destruction of the livelihoods of many non-white business owners, the very people the Democrats claim to work tirelessly to help. To the Democrats, people and communities are just pawns. If it takes rioting to get their way, the Democrats incentivize their supporters to riot, regardless of the damage to the identity groups they profess their love for. They don’t care if this erodes the law. They don’t care if communities burn down. They are unconcerned with unleashing the most violent rabble in our society as long as they get their way. The Nazis relied on the same tactic: using street violence and destruction to intimidate their enemies into capitulating to their radical policies. Trump never did anything to help rioters who politically aligned with him. He could have pardoned the January 6 rioters, but he didn’t. He also didn’t pardon or reduce the sentences of anyone who participated in the Unite the Right rally-turned-riot in Charlottesville in 2017. The Republicans have never been lenient on rioters who support them, whereas pro-Democrat rioters who exact way more damage upon life and property have the Democrats throwing the government’s weight behind them. So who are the real fascists (according to actual facts and data)? 
2022-11-20;https://www.speaker.gov/newsroom/112022;authoritarianism;Without any evidence, one of the highest-ranking Democrats in the party blamed a shooting on her political opponents. The Democrats act with naked authoritarianism on such a routine basis that it is hard to express how exceptionally alarming it is. How is it that Americans don’t find it completely frightening that one political party accuses its opponents of fomenting violence without a shred of evidence. The Democrats regularly manipulate public opinion to defame their opponents, insinuating guilt for crimes without a trial so that, should it come to a trial, the jury is already biased toward the Democrats. This is the propaganda warfare fitting only tyrannical regimes: declaring that one’s enemies are the secret authors of every act of violence, and relying on their subservient thralls in the general public to act out whatever vigilantism they wish in response. The left would lose their collective minds if a major Republican figure accused the Democrats of being to blame for the assassination attempt on Kavanaugh, the destruction wrought by the Floyd rioters, or the shooting of Republican House members by an avid Sanders supporter. And in fact, all of these crimes are much more likely to have been politically motivated, given the targets and the timing. In making these unfounded accusations, the Democrats are reading right out of the Nazi playbook: insist that your political enemies are behind every tragedy and social ill, and that they therefore should be ejected from society. Yet the Democrats blithely accuse their opponents of being complicit in murder, with no evidence to back it up, with the full knowledge that they have gangs of street thug enforcers (Antifa) that stand ready to enact lethal retribution in kind. Democrats know Antifa will go out and attack anyone they perceive to be Republicans in response to this baseless claim, yet have the audacity to condemn the Republicans as the ones inspiring political violence. It is absolutely sickening not just how cavalierly the Democrats do this, but how their supporters unquestioningly believe it. 
2022-11-21;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/starbucks/starbucks-closes-second-capitol-hill-store-citing-safety-concerns/;law enforcement;As much as the Democrats and their rabid followers insist that their cities are perfectly safe, when businesses have to make decisions based on actual reality, their decisions tell a very different story. In fact, all evidence shows that safety in urban areas is inversely proportional to how left-wing it is. Seattle is one of the most extreme-left cities in America, with Starbucks eagerly throwing its weight behind many of the most radical left policies proposed there and across America. And yet as a result of the very permissive and lenient law enforcement policies they backed, Starbucks is now forced to close cafes because it is so unsafe to operate. It would be a just reward for Starbucks and the city were it not for all the people who didn’t lend an ounce of support for these radical policies sharing in their price. 
2022-11-21;https://www.axios.com/2022/11/21/civil-rights-leaders-musk-trump-twitter;authoritarianism;The very people who appoint themselves the guardians of Americans’ rights is crying themselves hoarse that people, including Trump, are now allowed to exercise free speech on Twitter. There used to be a time when “civil rights leaders” used to designate people who stood for the constitution and free speech. Instead, those who have appropriated that title are using their undeserved credibility to argue that civil liberties means denying people the right to speak on the largest platforms on the Internet, the domain where most of our speech now takes place (and, during the pandemic, the ONLY domain where it took place). Is no one concerned that those who are supposed to push back on curtailments on free speech have decided that free speech consists solely of whatever the left wants to let you say? Is no one alarmed that collectively society has decided that the government gets to decide what is allowed to be said online? For the Democrats and their obedient, fascist, totalitarian leftist servants, they see no issue with this. This is the stuff of Orwell’s darkest nightmares: defining censorship as freedom, freedom as oppression. If the left is so correct then why are they afraid of what their opponents will say? Shouldn’t the left easily be able to prove how wrong their opponents are with facts and data? The answer is they can’t, that they don’t have facts and data because neither facts nor data are on their side, that the only remaining option is to just stop the other side from talking. Anyone who behaves this way doesn’t know a damn thing about civil rights. 
2022-11-21;https://missionlocal.org/2022/11/elections-director-john-arntzs-contract-not-renewed-by-elections-commission/;identity;San Francisco is firing its election director purely because he is white. The completely Democrat-controlled government indicated that it took no issue with his performance whatsoever, but that they were nonetheless letting him go in order to pursue its “diversity” initiative, i.e. hire a racial minority instead. If the races were reversed, everyone (on the left and the right) would be rightly outraged at the blatant racism being perpetrated. But somehow the Democrats believe it’s OK to racially discriminate against white people. This hiring decision is one that occurred regularly in the 1960s, in which hardworking African-Americans were replaced with white workers purely because of their skin color. The Democrats, so-called “progressives”, are literally reverting our racial progress back to the segregation era, all the while audaciously insisting that this is racial progress. Where King declared that “the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave-owners will be able to sit down together at a table of brotherhood”, the left is vowing that the sons of former slave-owners should be kept from the table as retribution for the misdeeds of their ancestors, that the sons of former slaves should seize the contents of the plates of the excluded. Anyone leftist who supports this neo-racism needs to explain how what they support is anything other than racism (in this case, against whites, but in other cases against blacks as well). 
2022-11-22;https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/22/health/vaccine-effectiveness-bivalent-boosters-cdc/index.html;COVID;After assurances that the only reason the COVID “vaccines” were ineffective was that they weren’t updated to the new variants’ viral RNA, a study has emerged indicating that the “vaccines” reflecting these updates are still not very effective. So what excuse are the “vaccine” apologists going to come up with now? The “vaccines” for the wild type (i.e. original sequence) didn’t stop transmission at all, and questionably reduced infection likelihood or severity, for the wild type. The same wild type shot also didn’t stop transmission at all, or reduce infection likelihood or severity, for Delta, Omicron, or any subsequent variant. And now the “vaccine” for the new variants also don’t stop transmission and barely do anything to reduce infection likelihood or severity. The “vaccine” zealots are 100% out of excuses. The COVID jabs don’t work. Period. It’s time to admit to the American public that you were wrong and apologize for the vaccine mandates.

We all know the old phrase “birds of a feather flock together”. Does any rational person really think that her husband, who has the opportunity to take down Trump, doesn’t have similar political leanings? In this day and age, when politics becomes a huge factor in romantic relationships, it is a near certainty that her husband is also firmly in the Democrats’ camp. And even if he’s not, do we really think this woman won’t put pressure on him to go after Trump as aggressively as possible? And for any Democrat bootlickers arguing that this isn’t a problem and everyone has political preferences, I suppose they would be just fine with an investigator whose spouse is a Trump die-hard investigating their preferred candidate... Of course they wouldn’t, and no one would blame them. So there is no reason to accept their bald-faced lie that having partisans investigate political opponents is something we’re all fine with and should just accept.

For Democrat proxies like CNN panelists, in one breath they insist on the sanctity of someone’s gender self-expression and in the next they speak derisively about the gender identity of someone they dislike. Like every other principle the left claims to stand by, they exempt themselves from it when it is inconvenient to them. And like every minority group they claim to defend, they think of such groups as nothing more than pawns to be manipulated and discarded as their debaucherous elites dictate. The left claims that they respect all expressions of gender because anything less is genocide to trans people, but as soon as this dispels their contrived political narrative they care nothing for gender identity and confer on it neither respect nor protection. These people don’t give a rat’s ass about trans people. Trans people are just a useful tool to discredit their enemies. Every trans person should be disgusted by this behavior, and every American should see the Democrats for the shameless, spineless con artists they are. 
2022-11-23;https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-trans-cnn-guest-claims-she-can-tell-that-colorado-club-q-shooter-isnt-non-binary;identity;CNN continues to commit transphobia (by their own definition) by bringing on guests who deny the Colorado LGBTQ nightclub shooter’s gender expression as non-binary. The guest in this case stated that anyone who visually observing the shooter would be able to discern that the shooter was a man. But by the left’s own rules of gender identity, it is transphobic and hateful to impose a label on someone purely for their outward expression, that anyone can look any way and be any gender. So how come this doesn’t extend to the shooter? And how is it not transphobic to do to the shooter what is called transphobic whenever it is done to any other trans person, even trans criminals such as the trans woman who raped prisoners in a women’s prison? The guest argues that no real trans person would shoot innocent people at an LGBTQ establishment. But on the other hand, why would a person who hates trans people identify as trans just to get out of a hate crime charge, and just to still stand trial for murder? Again, the left is simply using trans people, and they’re wiling to trot out other trans people who are willing to be complicit in the manipulation and dehumanization. 
2022-11-23;https://twitter.com/luckytran/status/1595560387751170051/photo/1;COVID;The majority of COVID deaths in August 2022 were of vaccinated patients, at 58% of COVID deaths. The author of the analysis, while commendable for sticking to facts which contradict her beliefs, still argues that the “vaccines” are effective because the effectiveness reduction is simply the expected product of “waning immunity”. This defense is illogical though. One, the unvaccinated either also have waning immunity if they had natural immunity, or have no immunity at all if they had never been infected, so that eliminates waning immunity as an explanation for why the vaccinated fared worse against the virus than the unvaccinated. If waning immunity were truly a factor, then the unvaccinated should be the majority of COVID deaths instead of the vaccinated. Two, “vaccinated” as a category includes anyone who had the minimum dosage up through those with the latest boosters, which were supposedly retooled to the new viral mRNA sequence of current variants. So again, if the “vaccine” was actually effective, this newly boosted population should be enough to at least make COVID deaths 50-50 vaccinated-unvaccinated. Three, under normal circumstances, any immunity, even acquired long ago or for a different variant, should confer some benefit over no immunity. While every vaccinated individual supposedly has some immunity, the unvaccinated category (again) includes those who have never at any point had immunity. Shouldn’t these unvaccinated individuals be dying at a high rate and make the unvaccinated the majority of deaths? So it turns out, when you actually apply reason and data to the data, the “vaccine” apologists’/leftists’ talking points don’t add up. But that’s never stopped them before, even when it meant discriminating based on people exercising the bodily autonomy the left claims to love so much. It’s stunning how desperately the left is clinging to its thoroughly discredited (by millions of data points and dozens of studies) COVID narrative even when the CDC’s own numbers can’t support it anymore. And amid all this evidence discrediting them, the Democrats still won’t apologize for denying Americans’ freedom to save few lives and in exchange crush thousands of businesses, force abuse victims to stay with abusers, spur drug and suicide crises, set a generation of students years behind in their cognitive and social development, and cede the global stage to China. 
2022-11-24;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01425692.2022.2122942;identity;A study in the British Journal of Sociology of Education indicates that teachers give girls higher grades than boys with the same competency for a particular subject area. In other words, when a girl and a boy are equally competent in a subject area (i.e. deserving of the same grade), the girl gets a higher grade. Education is the gateway to all other social and financial advancement. So if boys are at a systematic disadvantage compared to girls, then how is it even remotely plausible that there is some sort of patriarchy? If there were a patriarchy, wouldn’t boys get the unfairly inflated grades? How would it even remotely make sense for there to be a global bias in favor of males that somehow doesn’t boost them in education? Once again, the left has gotten their wish to discriminate and turn around and call it progress for gender equality. It is no coincidence that females enjoy an advantage in grades in an education system in which teachers are overwhelmingly left-leaning (and also female). And if the left doubts this, their own reasoning can be thrown back in their faces: people favor people in the same identity group, so if most teachers are female, why wouldn’t they favor female students? But the myth that males do not face a negative bias is now thoroughly shattered. This is only the latest and clearest data point among hundreds.
2022-11-25;https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-elon-musk-asks-for-help-identifying-violent-threats-on-twitter-in-response-to-antifa-revelations;authoritarianism;In evenly applying Twitter’s policy against advocating violence (the left of course lying in claiming that Musk would enforce no content moderation standards at all), Musk discovered dozens of Antifa accounts coordinating and facilitating violence, which Twitter’s former leadership allowed to operate unobstructed. These Antifa accounts not only called for violence, but provided instructions for how to commit the violence they advocated, supplied lists of targets and their whereabouts, and raised money to fund their attacks. This was all allowed to continue under Twitter prior to Musk’s acquisition. In other words, Twitter under its supposedly impartial leadership would let extreme left-wing terrorists operate with impunity while banning anyone who questioned the efficacy of the COVID “vaccine” (which we now know to in fact be ineffective). So the left dares to pretend that Twitter was previously impartial when Twitter allowed leftist terrorists could to use the platform to plot to kill people, but wouldn’t allow anyone to express the view that the COVID “vaccine” wasn’t effective. Explain how that’s not a massive left-wing bias, leftists. And explain to me how you (the left) would be OK if the tables were turned and a major social media platform allowed the right to plot violent terrorism while barring you from peaceful dissenting speech. Because if you (the left) were OK with how Twitter was previously run, that you have to be OK with suffering the same suppression that the right did under old Twitter. Oh, you would never tolerate that (understandably)? Then that means you (the left) were irrefutably in the wrong with how you allowed Twitter to run itself. You didn’t stand up for fairness in the adjudication of content moderation—you knowingly allowed Twitter to crush your opponents merely for daring to question you while letting your allied terrorist street thugs to plan violence openly in your midst. Anyone who doesn’t denounce the way Twitter condoned left-wing terrorism before Musk is a terrorist sympathizer. It’s that simple.

It is stunning that anyone continues to put faith in a party that has no principles, and can count on the media to turn a blind eye on all but its most salacious scandals. 
2022-11-27;https://thepostmillennial.com/msnbc-says-georgias-runoff-elections-between-2-black-candidates-are-to-keep-black-candidates-out-of-office;identity;The most loyal of the Democrats’ media servants has concocted a crackpot accusation that the runoff election process in Georgia, which merely pits the top 2 vote-earners—in this case 2 black candidates—in a head-to-head race whenever the general election does not yield 50% or more votes to any one candidate, is racist. Runoff elections are an accepted practice in most US states. They are merely a procedural means of ensuring that the elected representative has the support of more constituents than not. Without runoffs, races with strong third-party contenders would see winners with less than 50% of voters backing them. Given how much the left bewailed Trump’s failure to win the popular vote in 2016, one would think Democrats would support a practice which ensures that the winner of an election wins the popular vote. Yet when they are worried that a non-white Republican might win, the Democrats and their bootlicking media thralls trot out baseless and absurd racism accusations. Wouldn’t one think that, if Georgia’s runoffs were truly racist, the process would have found a way to put at least 1 white candidate on the runoff ballot? It’s a strange kind of racism indeed when a practice ensures that a black person will inevitably ascend to power. This is how one can be sure that the Democrats care nothing for racial minorities. Racism is just a cudgel against their opponents, not something Democrats seriously endeavor to address. That’s why they invent claims of racism where none are present, while conveniently overlooking the policies that would, by their own definition of racism, be deemed racist. Non-white people are just pawns to the Democrats—that in itself is the most egregious form of racism imaginable!

Why is Biden keeping the kid gloves on with China, an autocratic totalitarian regime beating thousands of its own people in the streets? His administration’s assertion of everyone’s right to protest rings hollow now that it is alleged that Biden pressured Canada to suppress its Freedom Convoy protest. It also rings hollow given his fellow Democrats’ bans on First Amendment-protected freedom of religion during the pandemic. So maybe that’s why Biden’s criticism of China was so mild. 
2022-11-28;https://alphanews.org/controversial-energy-official-charged-with-stealing-womans-luggage-at-msp/;moral degeneracy;An official in Biden’s Department of Energy who openly flaunts their abnormal sexual preferences in public has been charged with felony theft. Images of Brinton indulging in sexual fetishes one degree removed from bestiality circulate freely online, as this individual appears to have no conception of demarcating public from private lives. In a nominally free country such as ours, one is free to indulge in one’s preferences so long as they are legal. This extends to Brinton. However, Brinton appears to have no regard for the proper image that a public servant should maintain. We as voters and taxpayers should not have to be confronted with our highest officials’ sexual interests in explicit detail. However, when critics of the Biden government suggested that Brinton’s propensity to share their sexual preferences with the general public was an indicator of mental instability, they were condemned as bigots and transphobes. This criminal charge against Brinton has utterly vindicated these Biden critics. It turns out that people who are radically uninhibited about plastering their sex lives all over the internet often behave in erratic and sometimes criminal ways. But this is the identity politics game that the Democrats play. They try to sneak in mentally unstable radicals, belonging to some minority identity group, into the government, and then when Republicans criticize the individual’s conduct, Democrats reinterpret it as prejudice against the individual’s identity. In other words, Democrats use identity as a shield to resist attacks on their nominees’ characters and fitness to lead. As a result, if the American public is cowed into silence for fear of being called a bigot, we will be rewarded with extreme leftist lunatics.

There are numerous images and videos showing just how chummy Democrats are with their crooked number 2 donor. They have the audacity, though, to head up an inquiry into their scumbag funder with party members who are on video showing just how close they are. If the Republicans investigated one of their own shady donors, the Democrats and their loyal media lapdogs would make sure no American ever heard the end of it (as they rightly should). Yet the media has nothing to say on this patently unethical behavior. Yet again, it is clear that the Democrats believe they are above ethics and rules, that they are merely obstacles to be imposed on their opponents. The Democrats stand for nothing, and will avail themselves of every benefit that corruption can gain them, sleeping soundly knowing that the media will cover for them to make sure Americans never hear about it (with rare exceptions). Put another way, the media, which is supposed to hold all public servants accountable regardless of power, colludes with the Democrats in the suppression of information which would reveal Democrats’ corruption. This party has no business being anywhere near power. It should alarm every American that the dominant party has the media in its pocket and doesn’t even bother to hide how friendly they are with the slimiest people.

Isn’t it interesting how, in the places with the most ambitious Demcorat-led criminal justice reform, crime is rising the fastest? This is such a strong correlation that it is hard not to conclude it is causal—no alternative explanation even comes close. A 9-year-old can tell you that when you let violent criminals walk free between their arrest and court date, when prosecutors decline to prosecute muggers and robbers, and when the police are discouraged from making arrests in the first place, crime will go up. Yet somehow the left can’t make this connection, or pretends not to.

The Democrats were the ones who first threw open the doors to let all mentally ill people, regardless of the threat they posed to others, roam free.

Of course, the Democrats will never admit that their cities are overrun with vagrants, some violent. But their actions point to the truth: Democrat cities are in dire straits and they know it.

It is clear that Democrats feel entitled to use state coercive power to hound their enemies whenever it pleases them, but that they should not be bound by the same laws that they weaponize against others. This is the very essence of authoritarianism, which is ironic considering how Schiff condemned Republicans as authoritarian when they would not meekly facilitate the Democrat witch hunt against Republicans who dare to challenge them. The party that uses the state to demonize its enemies while exempting themselves from state power as soon as it is wielded against them is the authoritarian party.

But Brinton and many others on the left believe that this latter, morally repugnant objective should now be embraced in the sphere of public education. How is this even remotely appropriate? And more importantly, why are these views which people in positions of public trust not transparently known to voters and taxpayers? We have a right to know what  deviant and revolting policies these people are trying to sneak into our society. But that’s exactly why the left is keeping it a secret: they know that Americans won’t support these measures if debated openly. So instead, they are trying to undemocratically smuggle them into our institutions, including our schools. The contents and aims of these policies aside, no party that believes it should get to hide its true policy goals from constituents has no business wielding power. 
2022-12-02;https://thepostmillennial.com/watch-french-president-macron-has-to-redirect-biden-after-he-goes-the-wrong-way;mental fitness;Footage continues to emerge strengthening the already compelling case that Biden is mentally unfit to lead. After finishing a speech next to French President Macron, Macron has to tug on Biden’s hand to keep him from walking the wrong way off the stage. As he does so, Biden simply stands still, smiling like a twit, for many awkward seconds. Except for a few seconds where he exchanges words with Macron, Biden looks as though he has no idea what he’s doing. He looks like he isn’t thinking anything in particular. Is this the behavior of someone suitable to lead the most powerful nation in the world? How is Trump’s supposed mental inability to lead anywhere near this alarmingly bad? There is not any footage of Trump acting as cognitively vacuous as Biden does in this clip or a number of other clips. This is not to say conclusively that either man is or isn’t fit to lead. But to anyone who claims Trump wasn’t mentally fit to lead, they by definition have to conclude that Biden isn’t mentally fit either, since he is demonstrably feebler than Trump. 
2022-12-02;https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-11495051/Planned-Parenthoods-sexual-education-director-claims-children-born-sexual.html;moral degeneracy;The executive director of Planned Parenthood has stated that people are “sexual from birth”, and that accordingly “Sexuality education is not isolated to a particular point in a person's life, it's a continuous process”. This man’s statement is open advocacy of grooming. When you expose children to sexual content, it makes them more vulnerable to fall prey to sexual predators. What this man calls for is to expand sex education beyond the narrow boundary of adolescent children (to extend to younger children) and the narrow boundary of reproductive health and safety. When society breaches these boundaries, the door to rampant sexualization and abuse of children is flung wide open. If you think about it, this is perfectly in line with Planned Parenthood’s incentive structure... assuming they have no sense of moral propriety. They want as many people to require abortions as possible. Once adults are obtaining as many abortions as they possibly can, the only way to increase the market is to encourage children to behave in ways that predispose them to obtaining abortions. There is no way that the executive director of Planned Parenthood is anything other than a leftist. It is only the left that is pushing this moral decay. Their goal is to turn everyone, of every age, into a sex-addicted fiend so that they have more targets by which to sate their perverse sexual appetites. There’s a reason why end of the political spectrum with all the questionable sexual preferences is the same one trying to sexualize children.
2022-12-02;https://apnews.com/article/technology-china-united-states-national-security-government-and-politics-ac5c29cafaa1fc6bee990ed7e1fe5afc;national security;The director of the left-biased FBI is warning of the national security threat posed by TikTok, which Trump was condemned for warning America about. Once again, what the Democrats decried as a racist for saying, they are now openly saying without facing an ounce of racism accusations. Racism is merely a cudgel the Democrats use against their enemies, a practice which in itself is racist. There is nothing racist in suspecting that software made by a state-controlled company of a hostile nation could be a national security threat. It has nothing to do with the software developers’ race. It’s about the laws under which the developers operate, and the nation whose single authoritarian party installs party officials in their workplace. The Democrats don’t care about race, only what playing the “racism” card will get them. When they later agree with a Republican’s action they condemned as racist, the Democrats will simply gaslight the country and pretend they never opposed the action. This is the behavior of remorseless sociopaths.  
2022-12-02;https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1598822959866683394;authoritarianism;An investigation conducted using unprecedented access to internal Twitter documents shows that Twitter censored to advance political prerogatives, and that this benefited the Democrats in the overwhelming majority of cases. While the report does indicate that Republicans made censorship requests, some of which were honored, requests from Democrats were more numerous and more often granted because of how closely Twitter staff aligns with that party. Twitter employee contributions to political campaigns went to Democrats at a 99:1 margin to Republicans. The reporting includes internal emails of Twitter staffers unquestioningly censoring according to Biden administration requests, as if this is utterly routine. The most damning aspect of the report was proof that the Hunter Biden story was suppressed arbitrarily. High-level twitter employees declared that the story as reported in the New York Post violated the policy against circulating “hacked materials”, DESPITE the fact that many at Twitter outright knew this was just a false but convenient pretext. Some at Twitter questioned whether they could get away with invoking the hacked materials policy, but they did not dare reverse their decision for fear of giving away that they work for the Democrats. Former FBI lawyer and then Twitter lawyer Jim Baker advised the company to continue suppressing the Hunter Biden laptop story amid the uncertain applicability of the policy. Taken as a whole, the reporting shows a thoroughgoing willingness at the uppermost echelons of Twitter to serve the Democrats even when it required unfair and arbitrary applications of their content moderation policies. It can no longer be argued that Twitter applied its content policies fairly and without political bias. The truth is out: Twitter suppressed content, even wholly truthful content, that bolstered Republicans. Anyone who claims we live in a free society has to seriously grapple with the fact that those spaces in which discourse most commonly takes place serve one party
2022-12-02;https://www.amjmed.com/article/S0002-9343(22)00822-1/fulltext#%20;COVID;The supposedly science-respecting left produced a study suggesting the absurd conclusion that the “unvaccinated” are more likely to get into a traffic accident. I haven’t reviewed the data, so I am not about to claim that the data the study selected doesn’t show this. But it begs the question: how neutrally sampled is this data? It’s more likely that the left-leaning researchers cherry-picked data that would serve their conclusion. The unscrupulous practice of “p-hacking” is already well-known to be rampant in the scientific community, even before ideological bias is factored in. And then even if the researchers didn’t somehow cook the books, correlation does not equate to causation. More studies would have to be done to establish a link between not taking the COVID mRNA immune therapy and traffic accidents. If the same scientific methods as were used here concluded that those who DID take the COVID shot were more likely to get into traffic accidents, the left would rightly cast doubt on this finding. But anything that reflects badly on the unvaccinated is instantly accepted as unvarnished truth in the media and the cultural left. This is anything but deferential to science.

Whether Twitter acted in good faith or not regarding the tip-off from the spooks has no impact on how damning this document is. Even if Twitter was naive enough to take this national security official at his word, it means that the national security apparatus knew that it could stop the dissemination of true but damaging information about Hunter Biden by lying to Twitter and warning that such a true story was the plot of an enemy nation. The only other alternative is that the federal government and all its national security bureaucracies are so inept that they mistook the Hunter Biden laptop story’s publication by legitimate mainstream press for a hostile nation’s psychological warfare operation. This is just too convenient of an excuse. Notice how the document doesn’t state that the official waned Twitter of misinformation, but that an enemy nation was about to hack the laptop and leak the data. Any ordinary American could tell you that this is probably not what happened, as it was published by one of America’s oldest newspapers. Imagine the resources that the national security state has to determine the story’s true origin—in other words, the national security state must have known this was not an enemy nation but just journalists doing their jobs. So Occam’s Razor applies here: what is more likely, that the national security state was so incompetent that it mistook journalists operating in the open as an enemy hacking operation, or that the national security state knew exactly what this was and wanted Biden to win after 4 years of Trump berating them? What this amounts to is nothing less than treason. A defense apparatus of the US government used its authority to manipulate public opinion as it pertains to an election, in order that its preferred candidate would win. Everyone party to this heinous crime against liberty ought to be put on trial and, if found guilty, imprisoned for the rest of their lives.

It should be obvious to everyone that trying to divine political allegiance from outward public expression is extremely difficult. However, it is usually the best indicator the public can expect. When a shooter attacked a Democrat candidate’s campaign worker, the left immediately accused him of being a right-winger with no evidence. But when his social media accounts were analyzed, it turned out he had nothing but open contempt for the Republican party. Does that make him a Democrat? Not necessarily. But it certainly makes it highly unlikely he is a Republican. Even though authorities keep finding left-wing screeds among all the politically motivated shooters, and even though evidence clearly shows that the left has significantly higher rates of mental illness, the left seems completely disinterested in addressing the problem from within their own ranks. The Democrats need to be relentlessly pressured to put their own house in order before they dare utter a word of criticism toward the Republicans. 
2022-12-04;https://rumble.com/v1ysz0c-yoel-roth-says-satire-is-dangerous-at-knight-foundation-forum.html;authoritarianism;Twitter’s head of Trust & Safety under its previous, Democrat-subservient owner stated that a right-leaning parody website and an account which reposts (without editing) unflattering TikTok videos from leftists are dangerous (implying that they should not be allowed to operate). These content creators, Babylon Bee and Libs of TikTok, operate well within the bounds of the law, the First Amendment, and common standards of social decency (if a little on the edgy side). Babylon Bee is basically just a conservative version of The Onion, and Libs of TikTok literally just curates and reshares videos that leftists already openly post on TikTok for the purposes of shining a light on how some of the most radical left members of our society carry themselves. Calling for any kind of suppression of Libs of TikTok is especially egregious, because it consists solely of material that was already allowed to be posted (albeit on another social media platform). If Twitter moderators in the pre-Musk days were to be fair and consistent, to ban Libs of TikTok would require them to also ban the content it curates. But of course, this was not the case. When the very same content posted by Libs of TikTok was posted by the content’s creator, or another leftist, it was allowed to remain. This double-standard, wherein the left is allowed to express any sentiment—no matter how radical, morally repugnant, dangerous, or offensive—while the right is not allowed to so much as poke fun at or draw attention to any such sentiment, that is authoritarianism, plain and simple. This tactic comes straight out of the extremist left’s playbook, specifically an essay by avowed Marxist Herbett Marcuse entitled “Repressive Tolerance”. In this essay, he argues that the left should be allowed to engage in any activity, no matter how vile or violent, as long as it serves the left’s political aims, and that the right should be denied any right to express dissent, no matter how peaceful. To Marcuse, leftist violence and hate speech against the right is not only justified but encouraged, while the right should be persecuted for voicing opposition to this. This is exactly what we see playing out in America today—as James Lindsay says “we live in Herbert Marcuse’s world”. Antifa is allowed to burn, maim, and kill without any resistance, and online leftist mobs are allowed to “unperson” (ostracize someone to the point where they are banished from all online presence and can’t even hold any kind of job anymore) peaceful opponents while the right isn’t even allowed to make fun of the left or point to the left’s own content and suggest “you might find this concerning”. It can be nothing other than left authoritarianism when the left wields the state and immensely powerful corporations to silence the right from expressing their political viewpoints or beliefs. In the fleeting instances and isolated places in which the right holds power, they have done nothing of this sort: they have not denied the left from expressing their politics and beliefs, not have they used the state or corporations to persecute the left. The right has never taken away the left’s (or anyone’s) First, Second, Fourth, or Fifth Amendment rights. The left has and continues to deny these rights to the right. Anyone who supports the Democrats is an authoritarian and totalitarian, period. Prove that wrong, Democrats.
2022-12-04;https://twitter.com/christina_bobb/status/1599399706613923840;authoritarianism;A released document shows that the Democrat Arizona gubernatorial candidate and current administrator of Arizona elections, Hobbs, contacted Twitter and directed them on which tweets to censor (which were of course those which criticized her). Of course, private citizens who use Twitter are free to make requests to Twitter’s moderators. However, in this case, Hobbs contacted Twitter in her official capacity as a state government official to suppress tweets which threatened her election victory. This is the very definition of election interference, the likes of which can never be tolerated in a supposed democratic republic such as ours. Had the Republican gubernatorial candidate been the election administrator, and had she directed Twitter to censor pro-Democrat posts, the Democrats would be quite rightly outraged. But of course, the Democrats, who claim to believe in election integrity, have nothing at all to say about this revelation. They somehow are uninterested in condemning this election interference, because it benefits them. The Democrats are a party which has no respect for the electoral process whatsoever, and every bit of evidence which emerges revealing the true nature of recent elections only cements this fact. 
2022-12-05;https://nypost.com/2022/12/05/nyc-murders-up-in-november-despite-overall-dip-in-crime;law enforcement;Despite Democrats’ stubborn belief that guns are the cause of homicides, New York has seen a decrease in shootings (driven by an increase in gun arrests) but an increase in homicides. If guns are the main cause of homicides, then how is it that police can up the number of guns taken off the street but still see more killings? That’s because guns don’t cause killings: people wanting to kill cause killings. In a densely packed city like New York, knives and other melee weapons, or even bare hands, can easily cause immense carnage. But instead of addressing the social problems—poverty, drug abuse, a high and rapidly increasing cost of living—that lead desperate and troubled individuals to lash out violently, Democrats think that seizing guns will solve the problem. The data is increasingly indicating that it cannot. This is NOT to say that illegal guns should not be confiscated. They certainly should be. But that in itself will not address the problem. Moreover, making it nearly impossible for law-abiding citizens to own weapons for self-defense only means there will be more victims. The data sure does seem to show that the Democrats have no interest in reducing violence, since they keep pursuing ineffectual policies. Are Democrats just that stupid? Or is stopping violence not really what their obsessively anti-gun policies are about?

Does this prove that Fauci’s daughter played a role in encouraging the censorship of COVID-related information that diverged from Fauci’s official government narrative? Not in itself, no. But is it possible that she could have exerted influence within the company to serve her father’s interests? Certainly, it is possible. The ball is in the Fauci family’s court to prove that she did not abuse her influence at Twitter to grant her father undue influence over business decisions at the company, particularly relating to “content moderation” (i.e. censorship). This revelation is also just another instance of the webs of influence the Democrats seem to enjoy in multiple sectors of our society. It is of course possible that her employment was entirely coincidental, but it is interesting how these coincidences always seem to come through for the Democrats at the EXACT right time and place, such as how she was ideally disposed to help disseminate her father’s preferred COVID narrative by suppressing dissenting narratives on the social media platform she worked for. 
2022-12-05;https://twitter.com/MrAndyNgo/status/1599896886999031808;identity;Antifa violently attacked women, whom the left claims to believe ought to be protected, who dared to peacefully criticize some specific policy outcomes of the trans movement. These women questioned the impact on safety when a male who identifies as a woman is housed in women’s prisons. A male, even one identifying as a woman and taking estrogen, enjoys (on average) greater strength than a female, meaning that the capacity for a male prisoner to inflict harm on female prisoners is immense. The women protesting in Oakland were merely bringing attention to this very issue using their First Amendment rights. The left claims to protect women, that women are under constant threat of violence from males. And yet the radical leftists that attacked these peacefully demonstrating women not only demonstrated that they don’t in fact hold this belief at all, but ironically violently attacked these women. How is it that every single American hasn’t condemned Antifa for the terrorists that they are? How is it that they are allowed to operate unopposed and assault their opponents with impunity in multiple US cities? Law enforcement is merciless when cracking down on far-right extremists who commit violence, as law enforcement certainly should. Yet when the far-left goes around attacking people in broad daylight, the police never seem to catch the perpetrators. 
2022-12-05;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05594-0;COVID;A new study in Nature suggests that a cheap and highly available drug for liver disease can treat current and even future variants of COVID. Skeptics of the COVID mRNA shots in the medical field have long theorized and submitted clinical data suggesting that blocking the ACE2 receptors cuts off COVID’s infection vector, as is posited in this study. How is it that the mainstream scientific establishment is only JUST NOW discovering what these frontline physicians have known for a year or longer? And why were those medical professionals suggesting COVID treatment by ACE2 receptor-blocking drugs dismissed as crazy before only for this exact method to be considered seriously now? And where is the apology to these doctors who were derided and unrecognized at the time for being on what is apparently the cutting edge of COVID treatment? The public health establishment and pharma corporations are unlikely to admit that it’s because these alternative treatments are not profitable, as they make use of cheap existing drugs. As more evidence substantiates this COVID treatment method, it will be harder to deny that the mass deaths of people all over the world were caused by the pharmaceutical industry’s greed, and public health institutions’ complicity. Had clinical data of successful experimental treatment with existing ACE2 inhibitor drugs been taken seriously at the time, effective COVID treatment could have been made available quickly and cheaply, saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Instead, this approach—using existing drugs with long and well-understood safety profiles—was suppressed, savaged as being “unscientific”, in favor of the never-before-marketed-for-human-use mRNA immune therapies of Pfizer and Moderna. The ultimate historical legacy of the COVID-19 pandemic is well on its way (by way of this study, the clinical data preceding it, and the follow-up studies likely to come) to being one of greedy pharmaceutical giants stifling cheap, effective treatment to line their pockets with an ineffective, unprecedented gene therapy, at the cost of untold human death and suffering. If this history is borne out, and if our society has any justice, every Pfizer and Moderna executive, and every CDC and FDA official who signed off on their mRNA therapies, should be tried and imprisoned for the rest of their days.

Rates of theft in particular are staggeringly high, with casual shoplifting in full view of customers and staff is now commonplace (as a steady stream of videos will attest). The Democrats claim to be doing such a great job with crime and the economy, so how do they explain crime driving higher prices during this recession they won’t admit is happening? It turns out the Democrats, a party whose base and leadership are the coastal and suburbanite cultural and economic elites, don’t actually care what happens to ordinary Americans. The Democrats will blithely pay more for goods and services and simply hire armed security, as they’ve done in multiple affluent neighborhoods in Chicago. They don’t care about the hardships their reckless policies impose on you. You don’t matter to the Democrats, and they don’t care what happens to you. It’s time for Americans to realize this, before too much more damage is done. 
2022-12-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1600671188040445952;foreign policy;Greenwald, a truly free-thinking journalist of integrity, reminds us that Ukraine’s Zelensky is no icon of democracy, as he banned opposition parties before and during the war. Ukraine does not at all factor into US national interest, and their values are unworthy of expending American blood and treasure to defend. Ukraine officially includes a Nazi unit in its armed forces, executes enemy prisoners of war, and outlaws opposition parties. These are not people who deserve our help. So, as Greenwald soundly concludes, the only reason we are backing Ukraine is because of Democrats’ rabid, irrational hatred of Russia for interfering in the 2016 election, which may or may not have had any effect on the outcome. The Democrats are literally willing to risk nuclear war to help a country that doesn’t make any difference to any Americans, all to carry out a personal vendetta. As a whole, the Democrat Party has fully embraced utter insanity. Out of pure self-preservation, no one in their right mind should vote for them. So what does that say about those who DO vote Democrat (at least at the federal level, where they are empowered to pursue this reckless foreign policy)? A vote for a Democrat in congress or the presidency is a vote to flirt with annihilation out of pure pettiness. 
2022-12-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1600603788699701252;authoritarianism;The left is condemning as bigoted the right’s criticism of powerful corporate figures who colluded with the government to suppress criticism of their favored political party. This is a classic Democrat play in the 2020s: dismiss all criticism of a public figure, however grounded in reason and ethics, because the figure is some identity other than a heterosexual (and non-transgender) white male. In fact, this is a major reason why the left continues to favor elevating individuals of this background to positions of power. It gives them a bad-faith pretext for ignoring efforts to hold these individuals accountable. Gadde knowingly used her power at Twitter to suppress the right even when a right-leaning user broke no “community standards” moderation policies. In fact, the Democrats are so backed against he wall that they are even defending the white lawyer Baker, who literally went from advancing the Russiagate lie at the FBI to steering Twitter in service of the Democrats as a lawyer for the company. For Democrats, no accusation of misconduct against them is legitimate. And yet the Democrats have the audacity to complain that Twitter is reflecting poorly on them by airing out all the proof that it did the Democrats’ bidding under its previous management. So the Democrats don’t think it’s fair that to criticize them for working with a social media company to suppress its opponents, but that it is fair to be mad (at that same company) when it simply proves this to be the case and both sides to express their political views without arbitrary or partisan censorship. The Democrats have no integrity, and care nothing for values of free expression. The evidence only points to this fact more and more.
2022-12-08;https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1601019900071288833;authoritarianism;Twitter suspended the Lib s of TikTok account for “Hateful Conduct” even though they outright admitted in internal memos that Libs of TikTok had not violated that policy. You would be hard-pressed to find clearer evidence of social media using a supposedly neutral user policy to carry out its preferred political bias. I dare anyone on the left to justify this and claim they respect free speech. The whole world now knows that Twitter under its previous owners was indisputably an unofficial arm of the Democrats, going out of its way to unfairly apply its policies to punish accounts that dared defy the Democrats. And again, it should be pointed out that all Libs of TikTok does is take the unflattering verbatim words of the left and throw it back in their faces. There is now no longer any doubt that to support the Democrats is to support totalitarianism fascism. 
2022-12-08;https://www.axios.com/2022/12/08/democrats-2024-presidential-election-bipartisan;elections;The Democrats are openly warning third-party candidates against running for fear that Trump would win, meaning that the Democrats know they can’t keep their voters satisfied. If this is the Democrats’ prediction, that would meant that they don’t think a third option would take many votes away from Trump, but would take many away from themselves. That in turn means they know that they can’t hang onto their voters if there were other options besides Biden (or some other primary winner) and Trump. So what they’re admitting is that they have weak candidates with weak policies, and they know it. Moreover, instead of making their candidates more electable, such as by crafting policies which are more appealing to independents, they would rather just intimidate others from participating in the election and providing a wider offering to voters. What rational person can possibly have any confidence in such a party?
2022-12-08;https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1601007575633305600;authoritarianism;Another bombshell report sourcing internal Twitter documents shows that the practice of blacklisting and shadow-banning—practices which the company unequivocally denied to engage in—of conservative accounts was widespread. The evidence cited in the reporting to indicate the reality of these practices is extensive. Vijaya Gadde, the same employee who spearheaded the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story, outright lied in stating in 2018 that “We do not shadow ban. And we certainly don’t shadow ban based on political viewpoints or ideology.” This is only true in the sense that the company didn’t call their policies which amounted to shadow-banning “shadow-banning”. “Visibility Filtering” was the internal name Twitter used instead, a process which could consist of partial to total restrictions on an account’s inclusion in search results, the trending page, hashtag searches, and more. Examples of this abound. A doctor who argued that COVID lockdowns would harm children (which has now been proven beyond doubt to be true) was placed on a “trends blacklist”. Other conservatives were placed on a “search blacklist” preventing others from discovering them. Politically right voices were also routinely placed on a “do not amplify” protocol. All of these could be plainly seen as labeels denoted on an internal dashboard for each account. But for the right-aligned (or really just political, non-left aligned) accounts with the biggest impact, Twitter reserved a special accelerated process called “SIP-PES” which bypassed any official ticketing system and allowed top officials to make arbitrary calls. Libs of TikTok got banned via this process, with the company invoking the “hateful conduct” policy to do so even though internally Twitter censors admitted that this did not apply. Their argument was that the account’s content, showing shocking things liberals say out in the open, enabled others to act hatefully. However, when Libs of TikTok’s owner was doxxed (her non-public photo, name, and address circulated without her permission), which ACTUALLY enabled violence against her, and she appealed to have her information taken down, Twitter refused to take action. This report furnishes yet more evidence that Twitter arbitrarily censored accounts expressing views the left did not like. Not only that, but Twitter officials would unfairly apply moderation policies via unaccountable secret processes to do so. There can now be no denying that Twitter loyally served the interest of the Democrats by prosecuting a merciless witch hunt against vocal opponents of the Democrats. And wll the while Twitter had the audacity to ask users to trust its judgment. These are cynical partisans with corrupt ties to the government who believe they have the right to tell us what to believe. For a democratic republic such as ours, this is an injection of pure poison. And even after Twitter’s Democrat lapdogs were found out, the Democrats have voiced no condemnation, concern, or apology. We have a party in power that shamelessly embraces the suppression of its opponents, refusing to admit that this practice is wrong or antithetical to the First Amendment. This party, the Democrats, doesn’t care about free speech. How long until Americans realize this and stop tolerating it? 
2022-12-09;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63921007;foreign policy;Because of the Democrats zealous antagonism of Russia, Russia and Iran have now strengthened their military cooperation. As described above, by risking nuclear war to help an unsavory country against Russia out of spite for its role in the 2016 election, the Democrats have now not only gained nothing for the US but have actually diminished our national security. Russia has been pushed into the arms of China and Iran, moving ever closer to a bloc of regional great powers aligned against the US. How is it that any American supports this?

So how is it the Democrats claim they’ve never been stronger and that Americans favor their skewed views?

The documents cited show high-ranking Twitter employees begging Jack Dorsey to give them a pretext to ban Trump. When he obliges, the partisan agents in Twitter erupt with joy. How is this anything but the actions of rabid partisans? How is it that we allowed these people to dictate the speech which Americans are allowed to consume? Anyone who denies that Twitter served the Democrats has no leg to stand on anymore. If Twitter was exposed arbitrarily censoring Democrats, blacklisting them without their knowledge and making up new rules on the spot to do so, Democrats would be 100% justifiably outraged. Yet when Twitter was caught censoring Republicans, Democrats glibly shrug it off and respond with “well of course they do”, as if that is even remotely acceptable in a supposedly free society. To the left, it’s a matter of course that they will take every opportunity to silence their opponents, First Amendment be damned. These people have no business occupying any position of public- or private-sector power. It’s time for Americans to reject the authoritarianism and totalitarianism of the Democrats. 
2022-12-10;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB8Oja17QuI;identity;The rate of detransitioning (i.e. reversing the transgender process) is much higher than trans activists will admit, with rates sometimes as high as 30%. If these activists are so concerned about peoples’ health, why don’t they advise the patients they encourage to be trans just how many people go back on their decision? The answer is that these activists don’t care about trans people, people with gender dysphoria, or anyone experiencing any kind of mental distress related to their identity (or not). To them, they just want to recruit more people into their radical identity movement. An honest advocate of patient health would explain the risks, including the risk that the patient later abandons their trans identity and wishes to revert to a physiology consistent with their biological sex. A detransition rate of between 2% and 30% means that, in 1 in 50 to 3 in 10 treatments for “gender dysphoria”, or some other condition for which trans is the supposed cure, is a failure. To willfully remain ignorant of this or hide this proves that for the left, ideology is more important than human lives. 
2022-12-12;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-63947938;foreign policy;The Russian arms dealer we traded in a prisoner exchange for a WNBA basketball player in Russia immediately joined an “ultranationalist” party once freed. How does it make sense, to any thinking person, that we let a dangerous arms dealer out of prison for a minor US athlete? How is that even a remotely even trade? Anyone with 2 brain cells to rub together can tell you that the only reason the US went for this trade was so that the Biden administration could score a PR victory. Literally Biden wanted positive press so badly that he was willing to free a Russian weapons dealer to get an American home after only months in Russian prison. For Democrats, it’s never about the greater good of the American people. They do whatever helps them, and helping the rest of the country is only a distant afterthought. It’s party over country all the way. In addition to all the evidence, you know it’s true because they accuse the Republicans of serving party first and country second. Remember: whatever the Democrats accuse their opponents of is what they are secretly guilty of and desperate to hide.

Isn’t it interesting how the most dedicated lackeys of the Democrats and the left are always advocating for providing sexually explicit content to minors? This correlation is so common at this point that you’d have to be willfully ignorant not to see the pattern, and morally vacuous not to want to see it investigated. How exactly is it that we are supposed to trust someone with such questionable morals to police speech on one of the biggest social media platforms on the web? Highly placed tech scumbags seem to have 3 traits in common: an affinity for authoritarianism, a proclivity for sexualizing minors, and allegiance to the Democrats. 
2022-12-12;https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-biden-press-sec-says-elon-musks-criticism-of-fauci-is-dangerous;authoritarianism;Biden’s press secretary is saying that it’s dangerous to suggest that Americans should investigate the claims of powerful government figures like Fauci. It’s OK with the Democrats, of course, if any of their opponents are questioned or investigated. But when you express the intent to investigate one of theirs, they wail and moan that that’s just beyond the pale. Americans have every reason to investigate Fauci. It has already been publicly reported, by numerous outlets of wide political biases, that Fauci changed mask guidance not based on science but based on political objectives. That in itself is an abuse of power. So what exactly is unreasonable about expecting there to be more such abuses of power from Fauci? His CDC was also the one that blocked submissions on COVID “vaccine” adverse incidents to the VAERS database, and refused to pursue more research into claims that the COVID mRNA therapies were more dangerous than advertised. The Biden administration’s hyperbolic claim that it is dangerous to investigate one of the most highly paid bureaucrats in America is just running cover for what I’m sure they know are a lot of skeletons in their ally’s closet.

This, of course, means that Democrats were the overwhelming recipients of these tens of millions in illegal contributions. And because it takes 2 to tango, a donor and a recipient, that means that the Democrats or their proxies are almost certainly implicated as well. Campaign donations cannot be made illegally if the recipient refuses to accept them. So, if the allegations are proven, that would mean that Democrats are guilty of receiving illegal campaign dollars. For a party that believes in economic justice, this sure isn’t a very just way of electioneering. If the Republicans benefited from tens of millions in illegal funds, the headlines would not focus as much on the donor but the recipients, and the news would ensure that the American public never hears the end of it. This is a scandal potentially on the level of Watergate, and yet the news doesn’t seem interested. I’m sure they’d tell you it has nothing to do with the fact that most major news skews left.

As should be crystal clear by now, the Democrats are world-class hypocrites. But again, radical leftist theorists advocate for this intentionally. Herbert Marcuse argues in his “Repressive Tolerance” essay that the right should be hamstrung from any kind of political organizing, while the left should be enabled wherever possible to pursue any means necessary, including violence. So of course a loyal leftist would be untroubled by any cognitive dissonance on demanding safety online for the left while physical danger to the right in the real world. This is the ideology of the people who currently run our country: they may pursue even violence against their political opponents, while those same opponents may not even speak their dissent. If that isn’t authoritarianism, then nothing is. 
2022-12-14;https://www.axios.com/2022/12/14/long-covid-deaths-cdc-report;COVID;The CDC somehow has enough data to conclude that “long COVID” is potentially fatal, but not enough data to conclude that the mRNA COVID immune therapies are at all dangerous. There was only roughly 6 months in which there was COVID but no “vaccine”, so there is not much more data on COVID than there is on the treatments. And the treatments were supposedly studied rigorously by their manufacturers, with test summaries given to the CDC and FDA. But truly, there is no “long-term” data about COVID or its treatments, because COVID has only been around for 3 years. It will be many more before ANYONE has the data to conclude ANYTHING about the long-term effects of COVID or its treatments. So how does the CDC supposedly know that COVID will be deadly long-term? Probably because they want to keep pushing the “vaccines”. There is no data suggesting long-term COVID danger, but the fear of it will drive more vaccine uptake. It’s audacious of the CDC to sneakily push the COVID shot when ample evidence shows it doesn’t work. If it doesn’t work, why is the CDC making up conclusions to push it? Very strange behavior for an institution of “science”.
2022-12-14;https://www.axios.com/2022/12/15/biden-arizona-ducey-border-wall;immigration;The Biden administration, which is facing an unprecedented influx of migrants crossing into the US illegally, is suing Arizona for building its own temporary barrier to Mexico. Wouldn’t you think, if you were a rational person, that an administration facing a record number of migrants would want to have all the help it can get? A wall is much more humane than other kinds of hazardous barriers, more so than drones, and more so than law enforcement officers with weapons. A barrier also funnels migrants toward processing centers where those with asylum claims can state their case. It sure looks like on paper a wall would help Biden in every way given his policy objectives on immigration. But instead he wants the wall taken down. Even though CBP and ICE under Biden are detaining more people than ever, and are squeezed on resources to an unprecedented degree, Biden wants the migrants to keep streaming in. Either this is the most staggering incompetence of all time, or Biden is trying to sneak an open border policy past Americans and hope we don’t notice.

Antifa is finally being regarded as the terrorists that they are. Leftist extremists are taking over sections of cities and turning them into lawless zones, and the left and the media don’t seem the least bit interested in it. Doesn’t the left say that they are so concerned about domestic terrorism? Then why aren’t they concerned with gangs of violent ideologues wresting control of property away from the civil government? And how are these actions by Antifa less objectionable than what happened in the January 6 Riot, an incident of disorganized mass trespassing with astoundingly little associated violence which the left continually obsesses over? This just goes to show that, the breadth of the left end of the political spectrum is in agreement that the violent thugs on their side can do whatever they want, while anyone on the right who trespasses or damages property is the true terrorist.
2022-12-14;https://wherearethenumbers.substack.com/p/the-devils-advocate-an-exploratory;COVID;More in-depth analysis of CDC data shows that there is a strong correlation between the current high rate of excess deaths and high rates of mRNA COVID vaccination. The new statistical analysis breaks down data into different temporal periods to account for the mutation in SARS-CoV-2 over the course of the pandemic, as well as the gradual increase in availability of the COVID jab. What the study shows is that while COVID itself accounts for the excess deaths in the first 6 months of the pandemic, no factor accounts for excess deaths from that 6 month mark onward as accurately as the continued rise in vaccination with the COVID mRNA immune therapy. The fact that this conclusion was reached using the CDC’s own data, which is more likely to bias in favor of the COVID shot’s safety and efficacy than its risk and inefficacy, makes it all the more compelling. The sheer dangerousness and uselessness of the COVID shot is now all but proven. How much longer will the government continue maintain the delusion that the COVID jab is safe and effective?
2022-12-15;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-25617-0;authoritarianism;A study in Nature shows that political extremism on either side of the political spectrum is a bigger predictor of belief in conspiracy theories than alignment with one side or the other (namely, the right). The left loves to claim that support for conspiracy theories is inherently right-wing. The reality is that support for conspiracy theories mainly comes from populists and violent political operatives of all partisan affiliations. It is the behavior of authoritarians to suggest that their opponents inherently have no claim to truth, and that they (the authoritarians) have the right to dictate the truth to all. This conflation of the right with conspiracy theories is the left embracing this tactic of classic tyrants. 
2022-12-15;https://thereload.com/app/uploads/2022/12/CDC-DGU-Emails-Reload-Redactions.pdf;authoritarianism;Internal emails from the CDC show that they were pressured by anti-gun leftists to take down data on defensive gun use (DGU), i.e. when guns are used to protect innocent, law-abiding Americans from violent criminals. Why would an individual supposedly interested in reducing gun violence want to remove scientific studies on gun violence? Shouldn’t they be interested in the facts so that an effective policy can be crafted? The obvious, reasonable answer is yes. So the fact that anti-gun advocates are against data means that this is not what their policy proposals are really about. The radical left wants to convince Americans that guns are only used to commit malicious and senseless violence, because this then opens the doors to making guns all but impossible for law-abiding Americans to obtain. But this will never obstruct law-breakers from getting guns. All it means is that when criminals brandish guns, innocent Americans will have nothing to respond with. How does that make Americans safer (especially when the left wants to do away with the police as well)? It sure looks like the left wants to make criminals’ lives easier. The question is why? The fact that they haven’t answered this question is extremely telling.

The left will go to bat for giant tech companies with an authoritarian censorship regime when they are politically aligned, but as soon a company dares to target their side, the left suddenly believes that free speech should be extended into the private sector. Anyone who defended tech behemoths’ right to censor has no right to complain when the censorship comes for them. In fact, REAL civil liberties advocates warned that exactly this would happen, but the left went forward with the erosion of our effective free speech exercise anywhere. Now here we are. I hope they’re happy. 
2022-12-15;https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-admin-claims-nearly-every-covid-death-is-preventable-with-vaccines;COVID;After ample data shows the vaccines to be ineffective, and the COVID deaths to be majority-”vaccinated” patients, the Biden administration continues to lie and say that the “vaccine” can prevent “nearly every death”. Why does the Biden administration continue to tell this lie? Do they think Americans are so stupid that they won’t believe a huge body of data and readily available anecdotal evidence suggesting that the COVID mRNA immune therapy doesn’t work? There are likely many reasons, but one is probably that the Democrats are scared to admit that they took away Americans’ liberties and trampled over the constitution for nothing. And the Democrats would be right to believe that widespread realization of this fact could spell the end of their party. 
2022-12-16;https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1603857534737072128;authoritarianism;Another “Twitter Files” report showed that Twitter effectively worked directly for the FBI and DHS, taking down content these left-leaning agencies didn’t like in violation of the First Amendment. Internal Twitter documents made public show that the FBI was in regular contact with Twitter censors. Specifically, the FBI and DHS made explicit requests for Twitter to take down content, even self-evident jokes, to which Twitter dutifully complied, inventing a pretext when necessary. Twitter even received intelligence from the federal government with “no impediments”, and extended to the FBI a direct link service for them to drop complaints. What should be emphasized here is that this partnership quite clearly picked up once Biden was elected and assumed office. These agencies can, of course, be counted on to serve the left regardless of which party occupies the White House, but they are particularly uninhibited when the Democrats are in charge. The Supreme Court has ruled that it violates the First Amendment for the government to instruct a private company whom to censor. Documents from Twitter show that this is precisely what the government under Biden has done. What more evidence do Americans need to understand that the Democrats are a nakedly authoritarian party?

How is that Americans are supposed to believe that Biden is taking the crisis seriously when he won’t even go to talk to the people on the ground dealing with it day in and day out? Until Biden goes to the border, no one on the left gets to argue that Biden is taking the border crisis seriously. 
2022-12-19;https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-press-sec-dodges-question-on-fbi-censoring-hunter-biden-story;election;Biden’s spokewoman had no comment when asked if Biden was uncomfortable with highly credible allegations that the FBI knowingly interfered in an American election by suppressing the true Hunter Biden laptop story. If Biden loves democracy so much, as he constantly claims, why is not vocally condemning unelected intelligence officials meddling in a US election? Oh, that’s right, because the meddling directly benefited him. This also proves that the FBI is a thoroughly left-leaning organization, since it helped Biden even as Trump was in office (ostensibly overseeing the FBI’s actions). It’s time to see this tyranny for what it is: a state apparatus with extensive quasi-military power used that power to make sure the Democrats won. The Democrats abused state power to win the highest election in our nation. That is tyranny. It’s that simple. 
2022-12-19;https://twitter.com/ShellenbergerMD/status/1604871630613753856;authoritarianism;The newest “Twitter Files” report proves that the FBI knew the Hunter Biden laptop story was true and deliberately convinced Twitter to censor it, with a former FBI lawyer at Twitter being instrumental in this move. The FBI received a tip, from the computer repair technician in possession of Hunter Biden’s laptop, that the laptop contained evidence of Biden family corruption in December 2019. In 2020, the FBI repeatedly warned Twitter (and other social media) that there would be some kind of disinformation operation, despite the fact that FBI agents swore under oath that they did not have any evidence to suggest an election interference operation like that of 2016 (by the Russians). In August 2020, the FBI reached out to their top secret cleared former employee at Twitter, Jim Baker, to discuss classified information. When the New York Post published the Hunter Biden story, Baker doggedly insisted to his Twitter colleagues that the story was fake and a product of foreign disinformation operations. This reporting, supported by ample signed documentation and depositions, is nothing short of a smoking gun for the FBI meddling in a US election to install a Democrat in the highest office in the land. The FBI knew about the laptop nearly a year before the New York Post story, and it knew that what the laptop contained was true. With this knowledge, the FBI drummed up fear (among social media execs) of foreign interference which it KNEW was unsubstantiated by any intelligence they had. Finally, the FBI held secret meetings with its man on the inside, Baker, who then argued to the hilt that the Hunter Biden story was fake foreign disinformation until Twitter killed circulation of the story. This is an open and shut case of a national intelligence agency abusing its state-sanctioned power to interfere in an election to elect its preferred candidate from its preferred party. And, no surprise, that preferred party is the Democrats. There nothing more authoritarian than the use of state power to crush one’s political opponents. Anyone who has the nerve to argue that the Democrats aren’t authoritarian to the core has no leg to stand on. True, there is no evidence that the Democratic Party initiated, authorized, or enabled the FBI’s election meddling, but they have not publicly condemned this election meddling which elevated them to the presidency. That’s why a vote for the Democrats is a vote for authoritarianism. 
2022-12-20;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-64047688;law enforcement;In 2022, an unprecedented, staggering amount of lethal narcotics were caught being smuggled into the US over the US-Mexico border. Certainly, Americans should be thankful that this volume of drugs was seized before it could cause the death of innocent people. But if the US seized enough drugs equate to 1 lethal dose for every American, imagine how many drugs DIDN’T get caught. It is highly doubtful that this record seizure was due to a rapid increase in law enforcement effectiveness. Put another way, this haul was not the result of US law enforcement catching a larger percentage of total drugs being smuggled in. This can only signal an overall alarming rise in dangerous substances entering the country. And to go one step further, if it’s this easy for criminals to smuggle in so many drugs, imagine what else they’re smuggling in. 
2022-12-21;https://twitter.com/KariLake/status/1605689013653757952;election;An election administration expert testified under oath that 2 poll workers (working for different organizations) in the 2022 Arizona gubernatorial election observed violations in the laws stipulating ballot chain of custody. This is not, in itself, proof of wrongdoing. This is just the word of one individual. However, it is a serious claim to make, and one which runs the risk of perjury if the claim is found to be untrue. The evidence is mounting suggesting that an election won by the Democrat who oversaw the election was, by breaking election laws, open to fraud. The Democrats sure don’t act like the guardians of democracy they’ve anointed themselves as. If, indeed, democracy was so sacred to them, why do they so casually allow election law to be broken?

The left insists that there is nothing untoward about TikTok, but everything that leaks out about how the social media platform actually runs proves what a hostile and unethical outfit it is. It is already public knowledge that TikTok is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. With this report, we are seeing just how cavalier TikTok is as it spies on its users. Why is it that Western nations and their societies continue to tolerate this corporate conduct? How is the lost privacy of TikTok’s users worth whatever entertainment value it could possibly merit?
2022-12-22;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64066584;foreign policy;Russia interpreted Zelensky’s theatrical appearance before the US Congress, in which most congressional representatives evidently pledged unwavering support, as a refusal to pursue any kind of peace. This makes for an extremely dangerous turn in this conflict. The Democrats have already made it clear that they view the invasion of Ukraine as a proxy war against Russia, which they are clearly pursuing out of obsession with revenge for Trump’s 2016 victory. In doing so, the Democrats have cavalierly all but declared open war against Russia, a nuclear-armed state which has consistently stated for the past 30 years that having Ukraine strategically realigned with Western Europe is an existential threat to it. Now the Democrats have unanimously stated that they will back Ukraine no matter what it does to antagonize Russia. Explain to me how this isn’t completely insane for the Democrats to do? It’s not insane to want Ukraine to prevail over Russia. It’s insane to flaunt in Russia’s face, and with such audacious pageantry, that the US will not grant Russia any concessions and will instead implicitly back any act of aggression or hostility Ukraine may envision, including a counterattack against Russia. The Democrats have signaled to Russia that the US will not stop until Ukraine is a NATO nation, even though Russia has been clear for 30 years that they will not tolerate this. This can only be viewed as the actions of unhinged zealots flirting with nuclear annihilation to settle a petty domestic partisan political grudge. 
2022-12-22;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1605922963190079491;authoritarianism;Pro-Democrat journalists are making thinly veiled accusations of treason against Republicans for not baking Democrats’ deranged nuclear brinkmanship against Russia by way of Ukraine. This is nakedly authoritarian: any dissent from the ruling party is de facto regarded as treason. A nation in which dissent is criminalized is not a free nation. In insinuating that resisting their will is tantamount to freedom, the Democrats and their lackeys put us a hair’s breadth from decaying into such an unfree nation. The left rightly condemned Bush for declaring that any dissent on the Iraq war meant you were aligned “with the terrorists”. How is this any different? How is this not worse, with Democrat lapdogs calling for de facto investigation of dissenters?
2022-12-24;https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1606701397109796866;authoritarianism;Intelligence agencies pressured Twitter (and other online platforms) to censor (as “disinformation”) views critical of Democrats by claiming that they originated from hostile foreign actors. In yet another Twitter Files report, Taibbi submits internal documents showing that US intelligence agencies pushed Twitter to censor dissent against COVID mRNA jabs, the US’s involvement in Ukraine, and many other Democrat policy positions even when Twitter’s internal team could not identify legitimate grounds for doing so. To justify their proposed censorship, these intel agencies would fabricate a claim that the dissenting view was “disinformation” and that it originated with hostile foreign powers, usually Russia. It is damning enough for the government to instruct a private company to censor on its behalf, in violation of the constitution. But on top of that, the censorship was, to no one’s surprise, all targeting the opponents of the Democrats. Governments have abused power since governments were invented. But if this was simple government abuse, then why did it target the right every single time? To be a Democrat is to be an authoritarian, because no sitting Democrat has seriously challenged this behavior, and only a rare few have left the party.
2022-12-26;https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/26/us/politics/democrats-voting-rights.html;authoritarianism;The Democrats are now moving to censor dissent or criticism of elections by smearing such speech as “election misinformation”. The electoral process is the realm of public life in which freedom of speech must be most seriously protected, and this is exactly the area where Democrats are most eager to censor. Imagine if the Republicans announced that they were going to censor whatever speech they deemed to be “election misinformation”. Democrats would rightly be livid. And yet when the Democrats do precisely this there is no outcry from the media, civil libertarians, or the general public. Even at the height of their authoritarianism, the Democrats are audacious enough to take their abuse of power and assault on liberty yet one step further. I dare anyone who supports the Democrats to explain how it ISN’T nakedly tyrannical for the party which still wields the most significant levers of power in government to not only declare what views on the election are and aren’t true, but IMPRISON those who utter these latter views? Under this premise in which the Democrats decide the truth of elections, what is to stop them from cheating and then decreeing that all allegations of their cheating—including event those backed by the most compelling evidence—as “election misinformation”? Any political faction with such power is guaranteed to do precisely that. This is all the more likely given the Democrats’ pattern of “anti-disinformation” initiatives. Notice how everything issue they have addressed using censorship for which primary source documents emerged has been proven to be true. First the Democrats said that denying Trump-Russia collusion was disinformation, and it turned out there was no evidence of such collusion—instead, the evidence actually shows that Obama administration lawyers cited fabricated documents to get the FISA court to approve surveillance on the Trump campaign. Then the Democrats said that the Lab Leak Theory for COVID was disinformation, only for the government to later state that this is the most likely theory. Then the Democrats in the Biden administration went back and forth on mask guidance numerous times, irrespective of what the data indicated on the subject. Remember that first Fauci advised that masks weren’t necessary, but only because he wanted to stop a shortage for medical workers, and later Fauci stated that the vaccinated didn’t need masks, but only to encourage more people to get the jab. Then the Democrats said that doubting the COVID mRNA jab’s ability to stop transmission was disinformation, only for numerous studies and datasets to emerge proving that the jab never stopped the spread. Then the Democrats said that the “vaccines” have no side effects, only for studies to show that men under 40 are more likely to get myocarditis from the “vaccines” than from COVID. So far, on every issue in which the Democrats censored their opponents, the Democrats turned out to be wrong if not outright advancing a lie. So the fact that the Democrats have turned their anti-disinformation efforts to elections should make every American instantly suspicious that the Democrats are trying to draw our attention away from something. And if the Democrats were somehow unequivocally in the right about elections, why would they have to use censorship to convince us? Wouldn’t they be able to produce incontrovertible facts that show them to be right, without having to use censorship? In essence, censorship is never needed when the censor is undeniably right. Rather, censorship is only needed when one’s arguments are so weak that they are insufficient to convince anyone... and one’s arguments are usually only that weak when their view is untrue. If something is true, how is it so hard to find evidence to support it? On the other hand, lies almost never have strong evidence behind them. So what is more likely, that the Democrats are censoring anti-Democrat election claims (from their claims) because the Democrats are telling the truth but somehow just can’t find enough proof, or because the Democrats are lying and want to cover it up? What’s more likely? 
2022-12-26;https://nypost.com/2022/12/26/bail-group-shuts-down-amid-lawsuit-for-helping-release-serial-offender;law enforcement;The Bail Project is ceasing operations just as they got sued for bailing out a criminal who shot a man 11 times not even a week later. These leftist “bail reform” initiatives are zealously convinced that no one should ever have to pay bail, and anyone arrested should be able to walk free until their trial. This is exactly what they ensured happened when they bailed a man out of jail in Las Vegas and he shot a man 11 times 6 days later. “Bail reform” activists also claim that such incidents of violent re-offense are rare. So why did the Bail Project close down just as they were being sued over a supposedly rare occurrence? Don’t they believe in their mission to end bail? If their mission is so righteous, beneficial to the community, and popular, then why are they shutting down? Are they ashamed of something? This is why it is obvious to any thinking person that these left-wing social re-engineering projects know how radical they are and are trying to sneak it by ordinary Americans. And of course, the left definitely doesn’t want to talk about how the victim of this re-offense was a non-white person. In fact, a racial minority is the victim of these re-offense incidents in the overwhelming majority of cases. I would love for a leftist who backs one of these groups to explain how it’s not racist that their organization makes more racial minorities into victims of violent crimes, while their rich white neighborhoods hire armed security guards.

Settings aside the unethical and illegal nature of race-based hiring he advocates, how does this make sense as a policy when the US is already short on pilots? Airline pilots are already overworked, which increases the risk of errors and deadly plane crashes. I would love for Buttigieg to explain exactly how his policies help improve the safety of, and reduce cost to, American airline passengers.
2022-12-28;https://www.axios.com/2022/12/28/china-covid-cases-us-travel-policy-negative-test;authoritarianism;When Trump wanted to impose limitations on travelers from heavily COVID-hit countries, he was condemned as a racist by Democrats and the press, but when Biden does the same thing he faces no criticism. It is manifestly not-racist to limit travelers from regions of the world in which a pandemic disease is rampant. It has nothing to do with race, but only to do with COVID numbers from a given legal jurisdiction. So this is not to say that Biden SHOULD face criticism. This is to point out the double-standard, where everything the Republicans do is suspect, whereas the Democrats doing the same thing is unobjectionable. The Democrats, and their sycophants in the press, will concoct arbitrary moral standards to impose on the Republicans, and then not only won’t obey the same standards but will brazenly flout actual agreed-upon standards. 
2022-12-28;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1608193417263054850;authoritarianism;When Republicans go on vacation during a moment of political import, they get decimated by the press, but when Democrats do the same thing, they face no criticism. Again, the Democrats will impose a standard on Republicans which they themselves never intend to adhere to. It is not unfair to expect politicians to attend to their duties when leadership is urgently needed. But why does this not apply to Biden or other Democrats? This is because they have the corporate press in their corner. The press will always do the Democrats’ bidding, which means taking any opportunity to take shots at the Republicans and avoiding all but the most egregious faults of the Democrats. The sector of our society, the press, which is supposed to be impartial and adversarial to all officeholders not only sides with one party, but uses its position to advance that party at every turn. 
2022-12-28;https://nypost.com/2022/12/28/times-poll-shows-americans-reject-terms-like-chestfeeding-latinx/;identity;The overwhelming majority of Americans refuse to use leftist-devised propagandistic identity terms. The left has invented words with the purpose of skewing language itself toward their radical worldview. This is exactly what the authoritarian socialists did in the novel 1984: remake language so that expressing dissent from the new world order was impossible, because words of dissent would not longer exist. For instance, the left is trying to put an end to womanhood by replacing “pregnant woman” with “pregnant person” and “mother” with “birthing person”. They are also butting into the Latin-American culture by contriving the term “Latinx” because they are uncomfortable with Spanish’s gendered nouns. However, a poll from the New York Times, which is as left-wing as Fox News is right-wing, shows that large majorities (60% or more) would not use the left’s politically motivated propaganda terms. And yet even though most Americans reject these terms, they are enforced by HR departments all across America. The left is trying to overtake the country by colonizing Americans’ minds. And of course, consistent with the Iron Law of Woke Projection (credit to James Lindsay for the apt term), it is the left that is racist, sexist, etc. What is more sexist than trying to excise all references to women by replacing “mother” with “birthing person” and “woman” with “bodies with vaginas”. This term literally reduces women to bodies, to meat, which earlier waves of feminism rightly condemned as sexist. How are leftists not the real sexists? And how is it not racist to censor the language spoken overwhelmingly by nonwhite people? How is it anything but racist to tell nonwhite people how to speak and how their culture must behave? The words “latino” and “latina” are deeply ingrained in Latin-American culture, but the left sees nothing racist in trying to bring that to an end. America agrees that, if not the left, the products of the left are the problem. And yet this doesn’t stop them from imposing their minority rule on the majority.
2022-12-29;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1608521555218427904;authoritarianism;A sitting Democrat senator is decreeing, in naked violation of the constitution, that speech that the Democrats characterize as “hateful” or “violent” is not protected by the First Amendment. The evidence only continues to mount that the Democrats primary political aim is to end freedom of speech. There once was a time when civil liberties bodies like the ACLU understood that allowing the government to silence any speech opened the door to silencing every speech. That era is at an end, as there is now no mainstream civil liberties organization that stands by the First Amendment. Yes, there is certainly speech calling for hate and violence that we all abhor, but rights only function when they extend to everyone. Once we let one party’s decree create an exception to the First Amendment, then any party in power will invoke the right to create exceptions. And we already have a clear idea of what speech Democrats would exempt from the First Amendment: speech that insists on biological realities, speech that rejects allowing males into women’s prisons where they can rape with impunity, speech that initiates lawful challenges of elections, speech that points out the scientific evidence of health risks for medicine forced on us, speech that rejects the forcing of medical procedures and the violation of bodily autonomy, and any other speech that points out the glaring flaws in the left’s totalizing worldview. The Democrats have only gained ground toward ending the First Amendment and seizing the tools to impose their permanent reign. A one-party authoritarian and totalitarian state begins with the erosion of free speech. This effort by Democrats is no accident. 
2022-12-30;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-29/bankman-fried-met-white-house-aides-in-pre-collapse-crypto-push;corruption;Disgraced crypto fraudster SBF met at the White House 4 times this year, including 2 months before the midterm election. This in itself is not strange for big-ticket campaign donors like SBF. But it IS curious that he met with Biden administration officials considering that neither Biden nor the Democrats have any plans to regulate cryptocurrency in any way. What reason does a cryptocurrency tycoon have to meet with officials who are uninterested in altering his industry in any way? If this emerged about Republicans, the media would be doggedly hunting down every lead and every scrap of dirt. But because SBF supports the Democrats, the press is utterly uninterested. How does this not reek of corruption?
2022-12-30;https://twitter.com/ackocher/status/1607929468810842113;immigration;ICE has admitted in a FOIA response that it has lost track of nearly 400,000 illegal migrants despite them being fitted with location tracking devices. The way tracking devices work is that they constantly broadcast their signal back to the government computers monitoring their locations. These devices cannot help but create records. The records are not things which require manual intervention to receive or can be voluntarily deactivated. So the fact that these records are missing suggests that they were intentionally deleted. In any case, the Biden administration owes Americans an explanation as to how it is that during an unprecedented flow of illegal migrants into the country, they lost records on 400,000 of them who had tracking devices. 
2022-12-30;https://twitter.com/SonofHas/status/1607782699074297856, https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/20220121_Ray%20Epps.pdf;authoritarianism;Epps, a figure who was suspiciously overt in calls to trespass on the grounds of the Capitol, admitted in an interview with the January 6 committee that he sent a text message to his nephew on January 6, 2021 stating “I was in the front with a few others. I also orchestrated it.” Epps has been caught on multiple videos encouraging protesters to enter the Capitol building. Despite this, he has was quietly removed from an FBI wanted list and has never been charged with any crimes. Democrats insist that this is because he committed no crimes. But how is it that he is not being charged with any crimes for inciting protesters to break the law while the January 6 Committee IS calling for prosecution of Trump for (supposedly) doing the exact same thing? Why do the Democrats want so badly to protect Ray Epps? The Democrats also claim that Epps did not serve any federal law enforcement body, but their denial was worded in such a way that it actually left a lot of loopholes by which he still could have aided the FBI. It is undeniable that Epps was a prominent advocate of the criminality which took place in the Capitol on January 6, 2021. Alongside that fact, it is very suspicious that given how vocally he favored the lawbreaking that comprised the January 6 Riot he has faced no consequences. Epps’s incitement to lawlessness were objectively no LESS serious than those the Committee leveling against Trump, and yet Trump is being referred for charges while Epps is not. The January 6 Committee and every Democrat in support of it owes the American people an explanation as to exactly why this is. 
2022-12-31;https://www.axios.com/2022/12/31/stock-market-performance-2022;economy;The stock market in 2022 under Biden had the 7th worst year recorded since the Great Depression, despite Biden’s assurances that he was so much better for the economy than Trump. Every hit to the economy this last year can be traced back to the Democrats. Biden’s own advisers cite the pandemic stimulus pushed by the Democrats as the main cause of inflation. Then inflation was worsened by the economic sanctions on Russia that Biden insisted on, but which only strengthened the ruble, pushed Russia into stronger alliances with our enemies, and ended the Petrodollar regime that has strengthened American global economic dominance for decades. And let’s not forget that the Democrats were the ones who, even under Trump, shut down the country and ejected millions of Americans from the workforce for refusing to take an experimental mRNA gene therapy, which a 9-year-old could tell you would collapse the economy. And all the while Biden assured us that there was no recession even though the definition for a recession had been met (2 consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth). And of course, the stock market downturn is just the most concrete indicator of Democrats’ wholesale economic mismanagement, which was actually most acutely felt as the 40-year-record inflation Biden caused by all of the aforementioned policies. So how are Democrat supporters liking their “stronger economy” under Biden?
