2022-01-02;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1477634329446649858;The left is screaming that we are in some new, more dangerous stage of the pandemic simply because COVID cases are way up, even though COVID deaths are down almost as low as at any point in the pandemic. If COVID is a highly infectious airborne virus, and humans are social creatures that must interact for modern economies to function, why haven’t we accepted that the virus will spread among us regardless of how strict public health control measures are? Why is the left obsessed enough with stopping the spread of COVID that it wants to force everyone to be vaccinated and shut down businesses, but not with stopping the spread of other deadly diseases like influenza or pneumonia? If cases are more prevalent, but they are also more mild, then why is the left acting like the pandemic is in its darkest days since before the COVID vaccines were released? The focus is clearly on the wrong metric: cases will happen, especially since the vaccine seems not to be effective against Omicron, but its deaths we have to keep under control. 
2022-01-03;https://twitter.com/ScottAdamsSays/status/1478006717501763584;An audit of Maricopa county’s administration of the 2020 election revealed that, while the approved ballot stock uses an 80lb stock, ballots used as many as 10 stocks of differing weight. This in itself is not proof that the election was undermined, but that it well could have been—that fraud cannot be ruled out. When ballot paper stock is chosen for election security and yet ballots deviated from this stock, fraud must be at least suspected. And in an election, even the suspicion of fraud is unacceptable. If fraud provably could have happened, then how do we know it didn’t? And if we don’t know fraud didn’t happen, then how can we say that an election was legitimate? 
2022-01-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1478084512701722627;When black people are shot by law enforcement and media reports on the victim’s moral indiscretions, the left at least insists that all victims deserve compassion which shouldn’t be minimized by attacks on their reputation and at most that it is racist. But when a Trump supporter is shot then the left minimizes the tragedy by pointing out that they weren’t of impeccable morals. The double-standard is such that if a victim serves the left’s interests, then you are evil and heartless to point out that they weren’t the best person, but if the victim opposes the left’s interests, then it’s OK to point out the victim’s flaws. 
2022-01-04;https://www.axios.com/the-rise-and-fall-latinx-latino-hispanic-142d2a32-5b01-46f7-b680-76d0ea0928eb.html;A prominent Latino groups is pushing back against (predominantly) the left’s use of the term Latinx to forcibly impose American leftist political dogma on Latino culture—imposition of culture, ironically, being something that the left claims to stand against. The Spanish language uses gendered nouns, and as any group would be toward their own language, many Latinos treasure and preserve the heritage of their language. Because of the left’s current obsession with gender-neutrality, leftists have devised the term “Latinx” to sanitize the Spanish language’s word which Latinos use to define themselves as a group, despite the fact that they overwhelmingly reject the contrived “Latinx” term. Ordinarily leftists recoil and condemn those who try to impose one’s culture on another. But when the left wants to impose its language policing culture on others, even those from a minority identity group which they claim to fight for, cultural dominance (what they doctrinally decry as “colonialism”) is suddenly not an issue they care about. 
2022-01-04;https://twitter.com/aaronsibarium/status/1478538279746252800;Yale students who are required to have full COVID vaccination and a booster, have been prohibited from even eating outdoors by the school. If the vaccine is so effective, why is Yale afraid of its vaccinated and boosted students eating outdoors, where COVID transmission is shown to be low? What is Yale afraid might happen? That these more-than-fully vaccinated students will catch COVID? And if they did catch COVID, are they worried cases will be severe, even though the vaccine manufacturers and public health experts have sworn that that’s nearly impossible? It sure doesn’t look like these school policy makers have much faith in the vaccine. 
2022-01-04;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4k9Ovt-nm8;According to computer modeling which has already proven accurate for SARS-CoV-2 predictions in the past, it is likely that the vaccination is driving the natural selection of coronavirus mutations that make it more infectious and less susceptible to prior developed human antibodies. Anyone who has taken high school biology could have told you that when an evolutionary pressure is applied to a species—like when vaccines are introduced to create antibodies for a specific mRNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2—it accelerates the natural selection of survival advantages. If there were no vaccines, coronavirus would have no pressure to evolve. There’s no reason to change what already works. But by introducing vaccines which help develop antibodies against a specific mRNA sequence for the virus, while the original strain of the virus without mutations will be quickly killed off, mutations that differentiate the virus from what the antibodies were developed for will thrive because they will not be recognized as easily. And over time, in a population of billions, these more resilient (i.e. mutated enough to be less recognized by antibodies) viruses will propagate more than the previous strain and take over. Finally there is sound scientific study, with a proven track record, that reinforces this fundamental biological reality in the context of COVID. mRNA COVID“vaccine” skeptics should fully expect to be vindicated in time when the model is borne out. 
2022-01-04;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2022/jan/04/joe-biden-coronavirus-omicron-variant-covid-vaccines;Biden claims that there is no possible reason why someone wouldn’t take the COVID mRNA “vaccine”—that Americans have “no excuse” not to do so—as though Americans shouldn’t be trusted to make their own medical choices for their own bodies based on their own unique health needs. It’s pretty outrageous that rhetoric like this is coming from a “my body, my choice” pro-abortion Democrat. The entire rationale behind abortion is that people have a right to choose what to do with their own bodies, even terminating a pregnancy. But apparently bodily autonomy goes out the window when the Democrats decree that a public emergency demands it. Whether you’ve developed natural immunity to COVID from an infection, or you are a young person or athlete who is fit and worried about suffering myocarditis as a side effect of the mRNA COVID jabs, or you have religious convictions which prevent you from using any product of fetal tissue (as the mRNA COVID jabs are), the Democrats don’t want to hear your excuses: they expect you only to fall into line and obey. 
2022-01-06;https://www.axios.com/obama-capitol-riot-democracy-greater-risk-27565770-2069-4fda-a4e4-1fecd923ef30.html;In trying to drum up fear and a pretext to persecute the Democrats’ political opponents, Obama is alleging that democracy is in greater peril today, with Trump and his supporters allowing the Biden administration to wield presidential power with only token rhetorical opposition, than it was during the supposed “Capitol Insurrection”. If, in the Democrats’ thinking, January 6, 2021 was the darkest day of our democracy, when Trump and his supporters supposedly wanted to overthrow the government—which they could have done by sheer numbers but didn’t make even the slightest attempt to—then how are our days darker now, now that Trump’s supporters are going about their lives and not doing anything to threaten the stability of the government? How is America in greater danger now, with opponents of certain Democrat party lines banned from any meaningful presence on social media, than it was on the day of the Capital Riot? How is democracy in more peril now, now that Republicans are seeking purely peaceful electoral means of resistance to the Democrats (e.g. the groundswell of conservatives winning school board elections), than it was when rioters trespassed on the grounds of the Capitol? No rational person could conclude that, and yet the Democrats are insisting on this because they want to justify the ostracism and punitive treatment of their opponents. 
2022-01-06;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-59892937;Biden claims that Trump tried to thwart the peaceful transition of power in spite of the fact that Trump had no hand in planning the Capitol Riot or the peaceful protest which preceded it—he merely spoke before those gathered for the latter—and in spite of the fact that the rioters did not so much as use any kind of lethal force against public servants, security personnel, or law enforcement. If the rioters in the Capitol on January 6, 2021 wanted to overthrow the government, why didn’t they? They certainly had the numbers to mount a coup, and if even a small fraction of them carried weapons into the Capitol building, they certainly could have carried out an armed seizure the building and all its occupants. And yet even so they did no such thing: they did not brandish lethal weapons, they did not use deadly force, and they left the Capitol of their own accord having not secured any change in government. They would have had to be the most laughably incompetent conspirators in human history to have sought a coup and yet not achieved it on January 6, 2021. Only Democrats, with their fawning, docile followers could believe such a ridiculous, contrived conspiracy theory as this. 
2022-01-07;https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/omicron-spike-most-vaccinated-german-state-heralds-nationwide-surge-2022-01-07/;The state in Germany with the highest rate of vaccination in the country also has the highest COVID case rate in the country. If the vaccine was so effective, this should not be possible. If only the unvaccinated got COVID (which should now be utterly disproven by a mountain of evidence), this state would have the smallest population (proportionally) that could even get infected. In Germany, the unvaccinated are not allowed in indoor public spaces (with limited exceptions), either, so there is even less chance of the unvaccinated spreading COVID. So is it that the unvaccinated in this state are socializing significantly more than those in states with more unvaccinated people all without going to indoor public spaces, or is it that the vaccine isn’t effective? What is more likely? What fits the evidence better? 
2022-01-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1479852756676624387;While Trump was president and the Democrats wanted to paint him as negligent, hospitals tested every patient who came through their doors for COVID and considered any positive results a COVID patient, but now that Biden is in charge and Democrats want him to look good, hospitals have begun distinguishing between patients hospitalized for COVID and patients hospitalized for another reason with an incidental COVID positive result. What’s more likely: that the staff of a large majority of hospitals around the country were all too stupid to make the distinction between “hospitalized for COVID” and “hospitalized (incidentally) with COVID” when the pandemic began and didn’t realize their mistake for the entire last year of Trump’s presidency, or that they didn’t want to publish more detailed numbers so conservatives couldn’t make a counterargument? Regardless, what is now known where this data granularity is available is that only about half of those with COVID in the hospital were admitted due to COVID. It sure puts those claims of low ICU bed availability in perspective.
2022-01-08;https://thepostmillennial.com/border-patrol-increase-fentanyl-seized-south-texas;US border agents seized 1066% more fentanyl in 2021, Biden’s first year in office, than in 2020. This is stunning in itself, because Biden did not change many of Trump’s hardline immigration policies. This data is consistent with the massive increase in migrants Biden’s first year saw compared to Trump’s last year. What’s extremely telling, though, is that there are not 10 times as many migrants coming to the border, but yet there IS 10 times as much fentanyl being confiscated at the border. If the migration flow itself is any indication, the increase likely owes to the perception (though, clearly, not the reality) among migrants that Biden is more lenient on immigration than Trump. 
2022-01-09;https://twitter.com/drscott_atlanta/status/1480295777213857799 [archived];The head of the CDC just admitted that the COVID “vaccines” don’t stop transmission, and didn’t even claim in the same statement that they even REDUCED transmission. What more proof do people need that the vaccinated still spread COVID? And how effective is a vaccine if it still allowed the vaccinated individual to spread the disease for which they are vaccinated? Would anyone trust a measles vaccine if the vaccinated individual could still catch and spread measles? Of course not. By definition, a vaccine prevents transmission. That’s why the mRNA COVID shots aren’t vaccines: they’re experimental mRNA immunotherapies. More importantly, if the highest health authority in America admitted that the COVID shot doesn’t stop the spread, why are cities continuing to introduce vaccine mandate policies premised specifically on the notion that such policies would stop the spread? 
2022-01-10;https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2022-01-10/why-shouldnt-we-dance-on-the-graves-of-anti-vaxxers;A column in one of America’s (historically) most prestigious newspapers is advocating that those who took the COVID mRNA shot jeer at and celebrate the deaths of those who did not. It is hard to think of more sickening conduct to encourage in our society. And such behavior, already present at a small scale, would only reinforce the fact that the “unvaccinated” are treated as second-class citizens in their own country. How can anyone who behaves this way seriously contend that they have right on their side? How could anyone who truly DID have right on their side stomach such repulsive behavior?
2022-01-11;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-11/repeat-booster-shots-risk-overloading-immune-system-ema-says;Drug regulators in the EU are saying that taking COVID shot boosters every 4 months could weaken the immune system. This makes logical intuitive sense, as the mRNA shot submits instructions to every human cell uses its cellular molecular resources to make COVID spike proteins. The body then reacts adversely to these spike proteins and generates antibodies. Essentially, this would mean that to take a booster every 4 months would be, from the immune system’s perspective, to attack the body every 4 months. This would almost certainly fatigue the immune system, just as being sick with the flu every 4 months would be. We also know that the SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins are cytotoxic, including those manufactured by cells at the behest of the mRNA it receives from the COVID shots. This gradual exhaustion of the immune system may well counteract any benefit that priming it against COVID (using its intended mechanism) would provide. 
2022-01-11;https://www.axios.com/justice-department-domestic-terrorism-unit-1a025d5e-09d1-46ca-ac77-cc60ca687d1b.html;Days after the 1-year anniversary of the “Insurrection” of January 6, 2021, the federal government has announced its intention to form an anti-domestic terrorism unit, opening the door to untold abuses which will almost assuredly visit the political right first. As the War On Terror has amply proven, terrorism provides the government with a pretext to dispense with the normal, constitutionally mandated legal protections that the accused enjoy. For example, while criminal suspects must be charged with a crime to be detained, terror suspects can be detained indefinitely without charge, as those interned at Guantanamo Bay know too well. Criminal suspects are also constitutionally protected against arbitrary search and seizure without a warrant by the Fourth Amendment, but terror suspects can be readily spied upon with little court authorization necessary, if any. The timing on this proclamation was not a coincidence: publicized days after the 1-year anniversary of what Democrats are hailing as a right-wing attempt to overthrow the government, this prospective agency would go after the Democrats’ opponents first. Freed of the shackles of the constitution, this agency would persecute the right (or any who oppose the left) with abandon. And don’t believe the assurances of the Democrats that they are not trying to persecute the entire right, just the “extremists”. There is a reason why they are so casual with accusations of “white supremacy”. Opponents of racial favoritism toward nonwhites for monoclonal antibody treatment are being tarred as “white supremacists”, which is all that an “anti-domestic terror” unit would need to view them as a danger worth at least monitoring and at most apprehending. The same goes for opponents of the bias toward Critical Race Theory in many public schools, or of parents organizing to remove sexually explicit books from school libraries, or of advocates of voter ID bills. The list goes on. If anyone fitting these political alignments gets too impassioned about their cause, they just might get a no-fly list, or have their phone tapped, or have agents infiltrate their churches… the same treatment Muslims got (often unfairly) during the War On Terror. What the left, in its glee at the prospect of rounding up their opponents, forgets is that granting the government these powers is dangerous because it is nearly impossible to strip it of those powers, and those powers may well be turned on them in the future. Once the government uses its vast new domestic anti-terror powers against the left, then they’ll be sorry. But it will be too late. 
2022-01-11;https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/01/fda-head-omicron-is-a-natural-disaster-most-people-are-gonna-get-covid/;The head of the FDA flatly admitted that most Americans, implying the absence of distinction between the vaccinated and unvaccinated, will catch COVID. This is the same FDA head stood by the mRNA vaccines for the last year because they were so safe and so effective. At best, this concession shows that the FDA as it currently stands is totally unfit to judge the efficacy of drugs that the government then pushes on citizens, and at worst suggests that the FDA was selling us a bill of goods when it pushed the vaccines and didn’t care. In spite of this admission, the agency CONTINUES to stand by the safety and efficacy of the vaccines, and has not spoken out against vaccine mandates which accomplish nothing save the ostracism of Americans who value their bodily autonomy. These comments invalidate every effort on the Democrats’ part to push the vaccine and punish those who decline it. 
2022-01-12;https://www.axios.com/inflation-consumer-price-index-december-baff6f4e-9572-4d2c-8b21-d2a7fd57d3cc.html;Even with businesses back open, under Biden’s watch inflation has reached 7%, its highest rate in 40 years. This is the same Biden who claimed he was better for the economy, and whose loyal party allies ensured the destruction of the economy under Trump (so he would lose to Biden) by locking down their states.
2022-01-13;https://blockclubchicago.org/2022/01/13/more-than-2-in-3-chicagoans-feel-unsafe-in-their-own-neighborhoods-chicago-index-survey-finds/;More than 2/3 of Chicago residents, who are overwhelmingly politically left and thus likely supported the Defund the Police movement, now feel that their neighborhoods aren’t safe. Again, because these liberal residents threw a fit any time a black person was harmed by the police for any reason, the police pulled back to appease them and now criminals are running amok knowing no one will dare to stop them. It’s an incentive structure so simple a 9-year-old could have explained that this would happen. And yet now the same leftists who made their city unsafe have the nerve to complain about it? The richest irony is that the crime that their policies enabled are hurting racial minorities the hardest, and making their neighborhoods the most dangerous. 
2022-01-13;https://www.axios.com/supreme-court-biden-covid-vaccine-mandate-1dc48f8a-1f37-4af1-aecd-0f6625afd5c4.html;The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that the Biden administration does not have the legal authority to use OSHA to coerce companies into requiring their employees to be vaccinated. In a nation founded on the ideals of individual liberty and the sovereignty of the states, this is the only just and prudent outcome. It is dangerous to accord any president the right to make companies push medical treatments on employees, and alarming that the Democrats (via Biden) tried to do so—the fact that Biden even attempted this should have alarmed labor rights activists but, of course, being overwhelmingly Democrats, they cheered this. We are a nation of laws, laws which bind even the president. Even if every American supported the OSHA vaccine mandates, the law clearly does not empower the president to wield it as such. If such power is desired, appropriate laws must be passed. But that is just how badly the Democrats want to control Americans: they are willing to run roughshod over our checks on executive power to do so.
2022-01-13;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1481623239038275584;In Minneapolis, vaccine mandates are being enforced using executive emergency powers approved in March of 2020 and never revoked. If the vaccines are so effective and available to everyone, why do cities and states still need emergency powers to combat the virus? Shouldn’t these powers be relinquished? Does anyone expect these powers to be voluntarily forfeit, at any point in the future, given how long executives in cities and states have retained them? And which party is wielding these emergency powers to impose medical compliance requirements on their jurisdictions? It is exclusively officials belonging to the Democratic Party. 
2022-01-13;https://thepostmillennial.com/biden-demands-that-social-media-companies-censor;Biden has directed private social media companies to censor what his administration deems to be disinformation, so that they can sidestep the First Amendment violation which would ensue if his administration did so itself. As Greenwald shrewdly pointed out, the Supreme Court has ruled in the past that the government implicitly threatening private companies to carry out censorship which it cannot is itself a First Amendment violation. This makes sense: what use would the First Amendment be if the government could just ask companies to censor people instead of doing so directly? Biden has already appointed regulators who are threatening to break up Big Tech monopolies, so social media has good reason to believe that complying with the censorship requests would make them less likely to be targets of the Biden administration’s antitrust suits. How, then, can anyone justify this? 
2022-01-15;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-cdc-isolation-testing-omicron-1bea8a40-15d1-44d5-a429-2d1864840c96.html;Even public health experts are skeptical about the CDC’s new guidance that those with asymptomatic COVID infections can end their self-quarantine after 5 days. When even other experts who have been in lockstep with the CDC until now are criticizing its guidance, it is clear that the CDC has no more credibility on which to base its guidance. 
2022-01-15;https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/jan_2022/covid_19_democratic_voters_support_harsh_measures_against_unvaccinated;Almost 3 in 5 self-identified Democrats believe that the unvaccinated should not not be allowed to leave their homes, and 45% of them believe that the unvaccinated should be put in concentration camps. There is no other word for this mindset than fascist. As should not need to be said at this point, given the CDC director’s own admission, but it bears repeating: the vaccinated and unvaccinated spread COVID at the same rate. This means that these policies, in addition to being authoritarian and totalitarian on their face, also have no basis in epidemiological fact. 
2022-01-16;https://thepostmillennial.com/msnbc-contributor-calls-the-gop-a-front-for-a-terrorist-movement;A panelist on MSNBC characterized the Republican Party as a “front for a terrorist movement”, which directly and thinly implies that he believes that the GOP should be outlawed. Terrorists are criminals of the most dangerous kind, law enforcement should act on criminals (from most to least dangerous), ergo anything designated as “terrorist” should be criminalized. The Republicans aren’t the ones who are trying to impose federal election standards on all states in blatant disregard for state sovereignty. The Republicans aren’t the ones directing social media to censor anyone who questions the mRNA COVID “vaccine” (under thinly veiled threat of regulation). The Republicans don’t enjoy the support of an armed group that sets fire to federal buildings, starts firefights in the street, and seizes city blocks to turn into lawless zones. The Republicans aren’t the party where almost half its membership wants to put the unvaccinated in concentration camps (and lest a Democrat apologist point to Trump’s policy of detaining migrants, recall that Biden is doing the same thing but at even higher rates then Trump). So if anyone party is a front for terrorists (IF, which is not to say that it is), it would be the Democratic Party. 
2022-01-17;https://twitter.com/0rf/status/1483162321191149574;Data from Israel shows that a 4th dose of the Pfizer mRNA COVID “vaccine” offers almost no more protection against the Omicron variant of COVID than a 3rd dose—since even 3 doses still wasn’t enough to prevent many vaccinated people from getting COVID, this means that the vaccines don’t work. The “vaccine” may have been effective against the “wild type” (i.e. original), but if 3 doses won’t prevent infection and 4 is barely any better, the vaccinated have no more recourse. There’s nowhere left to go, and the virus will only continue to mutate to evade the vaccine for as long as people continue to take more doses of it. 
2022-01-18;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnMMYJKZvnU;In a candid interview, Dr. Cyrille Cohen, one of Israel’s top immunologists and a member of the Israeli government’s vaccine advisory committee, noted that (1) the Omicron wave will not be over until everyone—regardless of vaccination—has sustained an Omicron infection, (2) schools should have never been closed at any point during the COVID pandemic, and (3) testing for all individuals—again, regardless of vaccination—is much more effective at reducing the spread of Omicron than requiring patrons of indoor businesses to show proof of vaccination (referred to in Israel as “green passes”). All of this eminently rational, borne out by ample available evidence. In spite of this, though, Democrat-controlled American cities continue to impose vaccine mandates to stop the spread of Omicron, with Boston being the most recent example as of this writing. There is also no indication that any jurisdictions in the US will impose testing requirements in lieu of vaccine mandates, though this could be because of limited test availability and processing capacity. Even so, such commonsense measures are not even being entertained in the US, certainly not by Democrats, despite their vocal claims to “follow the science”. What more evidence does one need that Democrat-imposed vaccine mandates are not about public health but demanding submission to the state (controlled by Democrats, of course)?
2022-01-19;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1483907335181455369, https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1485961964044095496;Democrat supporters are now calling for Tucker Carlson to be imprisoned for making a rational case against going to war with Russia to defend Ukraine. Reasonable people can disagree about whether or not to intervene in Russia’s impending (by Biden’s own admission) invasion of Ukraine. There are sound arguments for either side of the issue. But because the consensus Democrat talking point is that we should go to war with Russia—despite the fact that the Biden administration essentially said it would do nothing more than sanction Russia—now the party’s loyal foot soldiers are calling for dissenters to be imprisoned as Russian collaborators and traitors. This should alarm every American. It is outrageous to label as treasonous the making of a case that would spare American lives and tax dollars which also happens to benefit a hostile foreign power. Or does this stem from Democrat supporters’ desire to believe the demonstrable fiction that the Republican party is an ally of Russia? It would certainly be strange for the party whose last president (Trump) was targeted by a hoax accusation of collusion with Russia and who saw no major Russian incursions into foreign states to be pro-Russian, and not the party who saw a Russian incursion during the administration of their last president (Obama) and is about to see another one under their current president (Biden) all while dropping opposition to a major Russian pipeline to Germany. But psychological projection is the archetypal Democrat pathology: the Democrats accuse their opponents of what they themselves are guilty of. Democrats were lukewarm at best on the last round of sanctions against Russia, and gave Putin a huge boon by dropping opposition to a Russia-Germany oil pipeline that will bring windfall revenue to Russia. But then they turn around and accuse the Republicans, who pushed for the same sanctions Democrats largely didn’t support, of being soft on Russia. As a good rule of thumb, if the Democrats accuse their opponents of something, there’s a good chance they’re guilty of that same accusation—the more vociferous the condemnation, the more hypocritically guilty they are likely to be. 
2022-01-19;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/mrna-boosters-don-t-block-omicron-south-african-study-shows;A study published in The Lancet suggests that even boosters of the mRNA COVID “vaccines” do a poor job of preventing infection. A reasonable person would typically expect something characterized as a “vaccine” to prevent infection, as traditional vaccines confer what is called “sterilizing immunity”, a complete resistance to future infections. But not only do the initial 2 doses not prevent mRNA shot recipients from getting Omicron, but a third dose doesn’t even do so. At this point, how can anyone who regards their critical thinking as rational and evidence-based argue that these vaccines are effective, even if they do in fact reduce the severity of Omicron cases?
2022-01-19;https://www.statnews.com/2022/01/19/those-who-recovered-from-covid-19-were-less-likely-than-vaccinated-to-get-infected-during-delta-wave/, https://fox8.com/news/coronavirus/natural-immunity-was-more-effective-than-vaccines-alone-against-delta-variant-cdc-study-shows/;Data shows that those who contracted and recovered from COVID were more likely to avoid an infection with the Delta variant than those who were “vaccinated” using the mRNA COVID shots. It bears repeating that anyone with a high school biology education could have reasoned this to be the case. An immune system which has successfully fended off a real COVID infection will be far more robust than one which only created antibodies from the mRNA-derived spike proteins. This is because the real virus kills human cells and replicates virally, and so the immune system must respond faster to limit the spread, whereas the disembodied spike proteins created from the mRNA “vaccines” neither replicate nor directly kill cells. This being the case, why doesn’t every vaccine mandate have a carve-out for proof of natural immunity? Shouldn’t those with natural immunity be exempt from COVID vaccine requirements, since they’re better protected anyway? Such a policy would not lend itself to the real goal of the vaccine mandates (which, one should recall, are only pushed by Democrats), which is to demand citizens’ obedience to the (Democrat-controlled) state. 
2022-01-20;https://greenwald.substack.com/p/congresss-16-committee-claims-absolute;The Democrat-run January 6 committee has appointed itself practically unlimited investigatory power, arguing that it is unconstrained by warrant requirements for investigating anyone at any time for any reason. The actions of this committee are worse than the House Un-Ameriacn Activities committee headed by McCarthy: instead of seeking out communist infiltrators to the US government, the January 6 committee is hunting down rioters who trespassed on federal property for 3 hours and inflicted no more harm than breaking a few windows and bruising a few police officers (all of which should be duly prosecuted, as every American should support). Worse, there is no reason why this committee couldn’t turn its prying eye into the affairs of anyone the Democrats can even tangentially connect to the riots on January 6. The unchecked actions of the committee open the door to future abuse at the very least, and signal the beginning of the de facto outlawing of the Republican Party at the very most.
2022-01-20;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60063594;As Biden stares down abysmal approval ratings and no end in sight for their main cause, inflation, he has already declared that the 2022 midterm elections may not be “legit”. If Trump had done this, he would be slammed by every major news outlet (since they all serve as free PR for the Democrats) and there would be protests in every major city in America. Part of his declaration hinges on the fact that Congress failed to pass his voting rights bill which, among other things, would institute a federal election authority to mandate how states must conduct elections, flouting states’ sovereignty to elect their representatives as they choose. It also makes unflattering implications that don’t exactly help Biden. If the US has had literally hundreds of elections over the course of its history, all of them held before Biden’s voting rights legislation, is he saying that all of those were illegitimate too because they didn’t adhere to his proposed voting legislation? Wouldn’t he, by extension, be saying that his own election to the presidency wasn’t above board? If not adhering to his voting rights measures makes an election suspect, then every election in the nation’s history has been suspect. And then a further implication is, if the Democrats are saying every election is suspect, what right do they have to condemn Trump for questioning the 2020 election? The Democrats themselves implied that every election ever held in America is not to be trusted. But at the same time they maintain that the 2020 election—in which they disregarded voting laws in several states to allow unverifiable mail-in ballots—was the most secure and trustworthy election of all time. This just shows how inconsistent, opportunistic, and stupid the Democrats are. When they’re on track to lose an election that is just under a year away, they’ll claim that no election has ever been trustworthy, but then when Republicans call their bluff and question the 2020 election, they backpedal and assert that 2020 was the most trustworthy election of all time. 
2022-01-21;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1484535272754884611;Pundit after pundit—dozens of them—have declared that if Trump, who won an election for president fair and square and who stepped down as president at the appointed date and time upon losing less than 100% fair and square, were reelected then democracy in America would collapse. It is pretty galling that the press, which on the whole sides with the Democrats at every turn, can proclaim that democracy will die if the Democrats’ most hated opponent wins a free and fair election. It is even more audacious that they do so as their Democrat friends take away peoples’ freedoms by enacting vaccine mandates and online censorship against anyone who questions the vaccines being mandated. How does anyone believe the blatant hypocrisy of a political party, via their steadfast press allies as proxy, saying democracy dies if their opponents win a democratic election? 
2022-01-24;https://twitter.com/coldxman/status/1485703543046746118;The same people, the Democrats, who are screaming that states can’t require IDs to vote because it discriminates against non-white people have no problem requiring IDs to go out to eat or go to a gym and supposedly discriminating against this same minority group. This is because the Democrats have no principles, other than staying in power and controlling others by any means necessary. They have no consistency on matters of even the most deeply professed morality. They will say and do anything to justify wielding power over you and controlling you. They’ll condemn ID requirements as racist when it might possibly prevent their base from voting for them, but they will welcome IDs to cast out the unvaccinated as filthy second-class citizens despite the clear scientific fact that they pose no greater risk to spreading COVID than the vaccinated.

2022-01-24;https://youtu.be/4zGXX6kDPBs;Data from the CDC shows that not only is natural immunity many times more effective than “vaccine” immunity for preventing COVID, but having both natural and “vaccine” immunity is negligibly more protective than natural immunity alone. As anyone who took high school biology can tell you, the antibodies developed from fighting a real infection of COVID are more robust than those developed from just seeing spike proteins created from mRNA instructions, because the former can form as a response to any and all parts of the virus rather than just the spike protein. How is it we are only hearing about this now, roughly 2 years into the pandemic? Did the CDC really not think to study this until recently? Or did they not release it until now because they wanted to keep pushing the mRNA “vaccine”?

If the FDA is going to limit treatments because of poor effectiveness against Omicron, then how come they haven’t limited the mRNA COVID “vaccines”, which are substantially more likely to lead to dangerous side effects than antibody treatments? Is it because many of the FDA’s political patrons and allies own stock in Pfizer, and the “vaccine” is significantly more profitable than antibody treatments? Is it because many of the experts on the FDA’s advisory panel have financial and professional ties to Pfizer? Or is it because they just want to make sure Americans don’t use a safe treatment because it might not work? 
2022-01-25;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/01/osha-will-try-a-different-route-to-a-vaccine-mandate-for-businesses/;After its attempts to push a nationwide vaccine mandate that would sweep up most American workers were rebuffed by the Supreme Court, OSHA is trying to find a new way to compel Americans to get the COVID vaccine. What’s even more audacious about this is that, in the time between OSHA’s announcement of its first vaccine mandate and now, the evidence has surfaced that the vaccine does not stop the spread and does not stop vaccinated individuals from contracting COVID—no less than the FDA head tacitly admitted the former and the head of the CDC explicitly admitted the latter. So on what grounds does OSHA think it can push ineffective vaccines—ineffective at least for the variant we have now, regardless of how well they handled earlier ones—now?
2022-01-25;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1485756706021941261;CNN “journalist” Brian Stelter condemned Trump for referring to a journalist as a “son of a bitch”, but issued no comparable expression of condemnation when Biden said the same thing RIGHT IN FRONT of the intended target. It is hard to find clearer proof that the corporate media is squarely on the side of the Democrats, giving them a pass for offenses for which they pillory the Republicans. When Trump mocks the press, the press cries state repression, but when Biden does it, they’re in on the joke.

To Biden’s credit, he did the right thing in apologizing for his remark, a courtesy Trump would never have done. The issue, though, is not with Biden for making the distasteful remark about an adversarial journalist doing his job: the issue is with the press for going nowhere near to castigating Biden for it the way they did when Trump uttered the same words against a journalist.

Biden ran on fixing the pandemic economy that Trump supposedly produced, but which Biden’s Democrat allies in state governorships largely induced via draconian lockdowns in 2020, and now he is failing to deliver on his promises. This shows staggering incompetence: how ineptly must you be managing the economy if your party destroys the economy by legally forcing businesses to close and you can’t get it to recover just by lifting most (if not all) restrictions on business operation? The left obsessively insisted the Trump made Americans’ lives worse, but what is worse than the economy destroying Americans’ investments—including retirement investments—under his watch?
2022-01-26;https://www.dailywire.com/news/biden-surgeon-general-suggests-joe-rogan-podcast-should-be-censored-big-tech-has-important-role-to-play;Biden’s Surgeon General is encouraging tech companies to censor anyone who disagrees with the government’s official position, as if the government has any right to ask the private sector to censor their opponents for them. As noted previously, the Supreme Court has ruled that it is unconstitutional for the government to coerce a private company, via explicit or implicit threat of retaliation, to censor their political adversaries on their behalf. How much more corrupt and authoritarian is it that the bureaucrat under a Democrat president is pushing Big Tech to censor their opponents when Big Tech employees overwhelmingly donate to Democrats (versus Republicans), as publicly available FEC filings clearly show? And, of course, the biggest litmus test of all whether Democrats and their supporters would tolerate this scenario if the shoe was on the other foot: would the left accept it if a Republican presidential administration’s Surgeon General told Republican-aligned Big Tech to censor a liberal critic? Of course not, and they would be right to take that point of view—freedoms should be respected irrespective of political viewpoints.

Although certainly not a panacea, contact tracing does make a tangible difference. It allows infected individuals to contact those with whom they’ve been in contact so that those individuals in turn can isolate early, reducing the spread of COVID if they test positive, until they test negative for COVID. Vaccine mandates, on the other hand, don’t work considering that (1) the vaccinated spread COVID at the same rate as the unvaccinated, (2) there are more vaccinated people in most areas than unvaccinated, and (3) the vaccinated are less likely to get tested, since they have been assured (until recently) that the vaccine makes them invulnerable to COVID, than the unvaccinated, who are not only aware that they are at risk for COVID (and take appropriate precautions) but are in some cases under obligation from their workplace to test for COVID weekly (allowing for the detection of asymptomatic cases where the vaccinated do not). It is quite strange that the Democrats defy this line of reasoning considering that they profess themselves to be the “pro-science” political party—unless it was never about science or public health but merely about controlling the populace and punishing those with whom they disagree.

What message is this supposed to send to Russia? Sending mixed signals in the arena of international diplomacy can lead to misunderstandings with catastrophic consequences. If Russia antagonizes US troops because it calls the US’s bluff that it won’t intervene, US troops do take action when Biden assured Russia they would not, or any number of other miscommunications transpires, it could easily spiral into direct war between 2 nuclear armed states. What does Biden think America will get out of taking this colossal risk? 
2022-01-28;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1487164691772227586;A passenger on a Spirit Airlines passenger was told to cover his mask because the tongue-in-cheek (and not at all profane) anti-Biden slogan depicted on it, “Let’s Go Brandon”, was “offensive” to the other passengers. It would be one thing if the passenger was displaying racial slurs on his person: in that case, fellow passengers could understandably take offense. But essentially the political speech of his mask was the equivalent of expressing “I don’t like Joe Biden”, which we SHOULD all agree should be tolerated even if it is at odds with one’s own opinion. But literally the other passengers bullied a passenger with whom they politically disagreed. During Trump’s term in office, many Democrat supporters proclaimed “Fuck Trump” and incurred few, if any, consequences. I dare anyone to produce evidence of a passenger being told to remove or cover clothing that said “Fuck Trump”. Robert DeNiro even uttered this phrase on network television during the Tony Awards broadcast and was cheered rather than condemned by mainstream popular culture. This is another example of the Democrat-constructed double standard: you can criticize Republicans with as vulgar language as you want, but you can’t criticize Democrats even in mild language. 
2022-01-29;https://twitter.com/AmyBeePhoenix/status/1487484029762945028;Merriam-Webster quietly changed their definition of “vaccine” during the pandemic, such that it went from containing inactivated microorganisms and conferring “immunity” to simply “stimulat[ing] the body’s immune response”—a change in definition which just so happens to go from not characterizing the mRNA COVID immunotherapy injections to characterizing them as such. Why is Merriam-Webster so concerned that the mRNA injections are classifiable as “vaccines” when they do not meet the traditional definition of vaccine? What do they have to gain from calling the mRNA injections vaccines? And what’s wrong with these injections NOT being vaccines? If the mRNA COVID immunotherapy injections are safe and effective, why should it matter if they count as vaccines or not? The answer is the pharma companies, the government, or both determined that people would be more willing to trust in the safety of the mRNA injections if they traded on the trustworthiness that most people regard real vaccines as having. In other words, it’s a con: by calling something a vaccine that’s not, people trust it like they trust real vaccines, a move which pharma and/or government would only pull if there was some reason not to trust the mRNA COVID shots. 
2022-01-30;https://thepostmillennial.com/poll-americans-candidates-scotus;More than 3/4 of Americans (76%) disagree with Biden’s promise to limit the field of Supreme Court justice candidates to 6% of the population (black women). It should not come as a surprise that a large majority of Americans want Biden to consider all qualified candidates for the Supreme Court regardless of their background. So the fact that he is explicitly eliminating 94% of candidates shows just how committed he is to radical left race politics (Wokeness). Also, how is explicitly using race and sex as a hiring determination not racist? What about all the qualified Latino men and Latina women who could serve on the court? What about all the qualified Asian men and women candidates? What about all the qualified black men? It should be clear to any thinking person that excluding them on these grounds—that they are not both black and a woman—constitutes illegal discrimination from the federal government. And yet not only is Biden proceeding with it anyway, but he has the nerve to say that this is actually to PROMOTE racial equality. How is it that supposedly just and fair liberals don’t see through this for the naked racism and sexism that it is?

Frontline doctors have been exhorting the CDC to study this for months, yet only now can news consumers find mainstream media outlets reporting on ivermectin’s promising COVID treatment potential. If doctors and public health authorities, as they claimed, wanted to pursue any and all routes to ending the pandemic as quickly as possible, how did it take this long to study ivermectin? Is it because the CDC just didn’t get around to it? Or is it because ivermectin is a cheap natural drug that competes with Pfizer’s and Moderna’s newly patented and expensive mRNA COVID injections?

There is an active effort on the part of the Democrats and their supporters to gaslight the “vaccine” skeptics by claiming that they never said the vaccinated couldn’t catch COVID. Here is ample proof that they DID say the vaccine prevents infection—they didn’t always claim all along that the “vaccine” simply reduced symptom severity. That notion is a fiction to cover for how wrong they were found out to be.

Meanwhile, thousands of small business owners lost their life’s work and endured economic ravages because of the lockdowns. And how many others suffered from drug addictions, depression, domestic abuse, and suicide because they weren’t allowed to leave their homes, go to work or school, or see their friends? Essentially, the lockdowns saved a minuscule number of lives while eroding the mental (and physical) health and financial well-being of many times the number of lives saved.

For instance, by August 14, 2021, the Biden administration hadn’t even directed Afghan allies to begin making evacuation requests to US personnel. A core component of Biden’s campaign was that Trump’s administration was “chaotic” and that he (Biden) had the experience to execute policy smoothly. How is this better than Trump’s policy execution? 
2022-02-03;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60239038;GoFundMe froze the campaign for the overwhelmingly peaceful Freedom Convoy protest for no other reason than that they politically opposed it. GoFundMe is not opposed to hosting funding campaigns for political causes. Not only that, but they are transparently partisan, in favor of (of course) the leftists of the world. Apropos of the BLM protests in Kenosha which precipitated Kyle Rittenhouse’s self-defense shooting of 3 assailants, GoFundMe directly contributed $500 to an organization called Riot Kitchen. Riot Kitchen’s activities included, among other things, filling up gas cans for use during the violent unrest in Kenosha, for which some members were arrested. So GoFundMe sees no problem with contributing its own money as a company to riot agitators, but takes issue with truckers trying to support themselves while they practice peaceful civil disobedience to protect their right to bodily autonomy. 
2022-02-03;https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-vaccines-linked-to-menstrual-cycle-changes-11643902386;A recent study found that the COVID “vaccine” may cause anomalies in women’s menstrual cycles, specifically lengthening the time between cycles. It should not surprise anyone that an immunotherapy which instructs cells to make organic compounds they don’t normally make—compounds which, recall, are cytotoxic—would interfere with the normal menstrual cycle. While cells make these compounds, they must expend cellular metabolic functions on it which they would otherwise dedicate to their normal operation. If cells have the same amount of resources but one more task to expend them on, everything slows down. This is biology 101. Is it any wonder that pregnant women are among the least vaccinated groups in America? Who knows what other second-order consequences the mRNA “vaccines” may cause but which have yet to be discovered?

Is Facebook claiming to know more about what constitutes medical falsehoods than the peer review panel at the BMJ, one of the oldest and most credible scientific journals in the world? What’s more likely, that Facebook has the facts and the BMJ doesn’t, or that Facebook is really just trying to push its favored narrative?

This essentially amounts to theft. Instead of automatically giving back all of the money, GoFundMe is keeping any of it that isn’t reclaimed within a certain window of time and giving it out to other charities which ostensibly align with their politics. Recall that GoFundMe is very clear on the bent of its politics—leftist—as evidenced by its direct contribution to leftist riot logistics outfit Riot Kitchen. What’s even worse is that the government can force a private company to shut down monetary contributions to an overwhelmingly peaceful demonstration by dissidents of the ruling regime. There is no other word for this behavior than fascist: the government is puppeteering the private sector into crippling the lines of financial support to their political opponents. 
2022-02-04;https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/04/harvard-medical-professor-says-its-time-to-move-on-from-pandemic-.html;A Harvard professor has come out urging people who would have reasonably robust immune responses against COVID to go back to their normal lives and consider the pandemic essentially over. At this point, the overwhelmingly dominant variant (Omicron) is less lethal, and anyone who has been infected with it has natural immunity for at least the next 6 months. There is no reason these people should not be at liberty to go about their lives. Every day that people who are reasonably resistant to it don’t do so is another day in which they don’t earn a living, support their local businesses, go to school, and keep our society functioning.

Biden campaigned on getting the COVID under control, and stated that any president who presided over as many pandemic deaths as Trump did should not be president. So where are the calls from Democrats for Biden to resign? Why isn’t Biden taking responsibility for failing the benchmark that he himself set for a president’s handling of COVID? Apparently, the way the Democrats (and their media allies) enforce it, standards on how many Americans a president can see die on their watch only applies to Republican presidents.

Granted, it is sensible to drop mask mandates because the masks that most people use are not effective, as they don’t have a small enough mesh, and masks have been shown to have a number of adverse side effects like fungal growths. On top of Democrats’ insistence on an ineffectual policy, they claimed that science supported it and are now dropping the policy even though the science they cited didn’t change. It just shows how the Democrats don’t stand for anything, and will forsake even what they claimed to be life-and-death public health policy to win elections, now that even their own voters’ patience is wearing thin on masks.

It’s doubtful that it owes to the vaccine’s effectiveness, since case rates spiked in January 2022 and the largest ever share of the vaccinated contracted the Omicron variant. Quite the contrary, the only way Fauci could justify declaring the pandemic as in decline—which could very well be accurate—is that enough people developed natural immunity from the January surge in cases that there is ACTUAL, organic herd immunity in large swaths of the US population (especially in urban areas), both among the vaccinated and unvaccinated swept up in that surge.

How can Biden claim to “follow the science” and stand against “misinformation” when making a statement that is clearly untrue? The COVID shot is clearly no longer effective against Omicron, if it was ever effective against the wild type: the mere fact that there were more COVID cases when America was 60% vaccinated than when it was 0% vaccinated is proof enough. Add to this the fact that in January 2022 the unvaccinated weren’t allowed in indoor public spaces in the dead of winter in major cities like New York and Chicago, meaning the vaccinated overwhelmingly more so than the unvaccinated were even in any position to spread in the first place, cements the fact that the vaccinated drove the record high COVID case rates. How can a president who ignores these facts claim to speak for objective scientific truth? 
2022-02-14;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60383385;In order to break mostly peaceful protests against vaccine mandate protesters, the left-controlled Canadian government invoked some of its most extreme emergency powers to freeze protesters’ bank accounts. Government action of this sort is solely the provenance of fascists. Only fascists would attempt to end a peaceful protest by rendering protesters unable to receive or access funds—essentially, make them financially destitute. The only thing worse would be to order police to fire upon the protesters. This isn’t about controlling violent elements. Like with every protest, there will certainly be at least some instances of violence, but these have been so rare with the Freedom Convoy that conventional policing techniques would be MORE than sufficient—this financial coercion isn’t for crowd control, but to end a political uprising defying the left-wing Canadian government. The Freedom Convoy protesters are 100% in the right, if not before then certainly that their own democratically elected government subjugates them with financial destitution.

As stated previously on this subject, what is more likely, that suddenly there is twice as much tolerance in society from Millennials to Gen Z (Millennial rate of LGBTQ identification is at around 10%), or that Gen Z is simply viewing the LGBTQ plus constellation of identities as a fad to participate in? Social tolerance does not change that rapidly, and individuals are born with the mental characteristics that predispose them to LGBTQ identities at consistent rates across time and space. In other words, to the extent that someone is “born” gay, lesbian, trans, etc., the rate of this happening does not change over time, any more than the rate of males vs. females being born (or at least conceived) can deviate from roughly 50/50. This shift in the youngest generation toward LGBTQ identities just so happens to coincide with the explosion in identities which require no lifestyle change or commitment (or at least explosion in public presence). For instance, being homosexual requires one to pursue sexual relationships with one’s own sex almost exclusively (as opposed to with the opposite sex, as is most prevalent). If a self-professed homosexual does not adhere to this lifestyle with consistency, it strains the very definition of “homosexual”. But declaring oneself, for instance, “genderfluid” does not require any lifestyle change: this identity is predicated purely on how one feels about oneself, and is permitted to change from moment to moment, passing whim to passing whim. So is it any wonder why more Gen Z identify as LGBTQ now that the plethora of lifestyle-agnostic gender identities burst into mainstream cultural consciousness?

This data, directly from Public Health Scotland, should alarm everyone. So why is the Scottish government hiding the data? Shouldn’t they be concerned with keeping the public safe, in which case they should give the public the fullest scientific picture they can? If they want people to make the best COVID-related health choices, shouldn’t they let people see the risks of taking the vaccine? There is no excuse for hiding data that contradicts the “the vaccines work” narrative. The only reason that a government is doing so is to hide the terrible truth.

The study, published in the prestigious and highly credible Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), was removed from LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft. How is it that LinkedIn claims to know so much more about COVID than a world-renowned physician that it sees fit to censor a study by that physician published in one of the world’s leading medical journals? Or is it just that they didn’t like the study’s conclusion, which is that natural immunity to COVID is long-lasting? 
2022-02-22;https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-extend-us-national-emergency-due-covid-19-health-risk-2022-02-19;Despite the fact that the nationwide surge in Omicron cases has subsided and the US has approached his vaccination targets, Biden has renewed the invocation of emergency powers. How does it even remotely make sense to seize emergency powers when the inciting incident to the initial declaration of emergency is DECLINING in severity? Such seizure of power is the provenance of fascists. Authoritarians must remain vigilant to maintain a constant pretext their extraordinary powers, declaring emergencies whenever possible. It seems Biden has done exactly this, even though large swaths of Americans now have natural immunity, as vaccinated and unvaccinated alike contracted the Omicron variant, from the January wave. 
2022-02-23;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1496627230671319046;The Biden administration’s response to a question about rising gas prices is that it’s being caused by the “cost” of “standing up for our values” in Ukraine… despite the fact that the US hasn’t done anything in regards to Ukraine that would incur costs. A “cost” would be deploying troops to fight in Ukraine, or purchasing less gas from Russia. Neither of these steps were taken, though. In fact, the Biden administration explicitly stated that it would not reduce gas purchases from Russia. The only way that the war in Ukraine could impact our gas prices would be from the disruption in the petroleum market. But then how would suffering this fluctuation, as every nation would (since the petroleum market and demand is global), count as “standing up for our values”? This statement implies we are willfully incurring a cost unique to and associated with an action we are taking for Ukraine’s benefit, but we are taking no such action which would incur a cost specifically in the form of higher gas prices. So essentially, this is just a deflection away from Biden’s disastrous economic policies. 
2022-02-24;https://www.axios.com/wanted-inflation-scapegoat-79bd4280-d757-4bf1-a27f-ccce1e8f8a1d.html;Instead of owning up to the fact that their disastrous economic policies have caused inflation, leftist Democrats are pretending that corporations just all decided on a whim to charge higher prices. While arbitrary price hikes across an industry are not unheard of—this is the definition of a cartel—this is rare and typically only happens in industries dominated by a monopoly or duopoly. Thus, the idea that all companies everywhere all coordinated and agreed to charge more for their products is laughable. Such a scenario is akin to a Prisoner’s Dilemma, where companies have no incentive to raise prices, because if they do and their competitor doesn’t, the competitor will enjoy more sales (since its prices are lower). This is why the supply-demand relationship has the single largest impact on pricing. Running up the national debt and printing more money are driving inflation, not collusion between all private sector companies across industries. Leftists are pushing this absurd conspiracy theory because (1) it deflects from their catastrophic mishandling of the economy, and (2) it erodes faith in capitalism so that these leftists can win over more supporters for socialism and communism. 
2022-02-24;https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/1496990828404875266;A prominent Democrat has called for ejecting Russian students from US universities, a policy which would be “racist” by Democrats’ own principles. A commonly held principle among Democrats is that any policy which singles out a race or nationality of people for an adverse consequence is racist by definition. As proof of this, Democrats would universally and vocally condemn a policy which ejected all Kenyan students from US universities. But because Democrats consider Russians “white”, it’s OK in their view to discriminate and revoke their privileges. This isn’t to say the policy has no merit—it could, depending on how, why, and under what circumstances it was implemented (e.g. ejecting Russians who study at universities researching military technology)—but instead to say that it is hypocritical of Democrats to say this. They can’t claim to be the party of racial justice and endorse views like this. 
2022-02-25;https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-masks-cdc-guidance-52aaae87-7ea5-4a3b-8ebf-66e3f542ef77.html;Once again, the CDC has arbitrarily changed its masking policy due to the shifting winds of public opinion, in spite of there being no updates in scientific understanding of masking. Previously, the CDC admitted to dropping its first mask mandate to encourage more Americans to get vaccinated. Now that the nationwide Omicron wave has subsided and Democrat governors and mayors across the country are ending mask mandates in response to a sharp decline in public support for them, the CDC is following suit. All of this is intended solely to cushion the blow to Democrats in the upcoming election. There is no new evidence that the virus increased in size so that the most commonly used masks will obstruct it, and there is no new evidence that the masks most commonly used by Americans have a weave that’s now tight enough to obstruct the virus. So there is no evidenciary or scientific basis for the CDC’s change in guidance. Either its prior guidance was unscientific or its new guidance is. Given the physical properties of the virus and masks, it is likely that its new guidance is actually more reasonable. But that begs the question: why did they issue the prior guidance when the science didn’t support it? It would seem that this is purely “public health theater”, an attempt to create the illusion of taking concrete steps even though they have no impact on public health outcomes. 
2022-02-26;https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/595919-62-percent-of-voters-say-putin-wouldnt-have-invaded-ukraine-if-trump;More than 3 in 5 Americans (62%) believe that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Trump were president. Such a strong majority means that even a fair share of independent and Democrat voters, and not just die-hard Republican voters, believe that Trump would kept Putin out of Ukraine. This just goes to show how weak Americans, even his own voters, perceive Biden to be. There is ample reason to believe that this would in fact have been the case. Obama and Biden, both Democrat presidents, pushed for the incorporation of Ukraine into NATO despite Putin’s warnings that Russia would regard this as an EXISTENTIAL threat. While Trump certainly opposed a Russian invasion of Ukraine, he did not push for its NATO membership. Instead, Trump beefed up NATO by pushing other NATO members to increase their monetary and personnel contributions to the alliance. But ultimately, the proximate cause for Putin ordering an invasion of Ukraine is the smell of weakness he got from Biden. Why? If, along with insisting on Ukraine joining NATO, Biden had come off as though he would deploy US troops to defend Ukraine, Putin would likely not have been willing to risk direct confrontation with the American military. So the fact that Putin DID send troops to Ukraine demonstrates that he didn’t think American troops would oppose him. Putin was right. Biden hasn’t sent troops, and at this point, it’s too late—Russia has pushed deep enough into Ukraine that US or NATO troops wouldn’t be able to turn the tide.

Not only is trust in the Biden administration on COVID diminishing, but it has dipped so low that the Democrat voter base is starting to lose trust. Biden campaigned as the president who believed in science, so how come he can’t get Americans across the ideological spectrum to trust his grasp of the science on COVID? It’s probably because over that time efficacy of the vaccine dropped significantly, so much so that many vaccinated people contracted COVID.

The Biden administration has rolled out a plan to use four-legged robots to patrol the border, which Latino Democrats have decried as dehumanizing to Latinos. What happened to Biden’s promise to treat migrants with dignity? Yet more proof that Biden doesn’t stand by any of his promises.
2022-03-01;MDPI: “Intracellular Reverse Transcription of Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 In Vitro in Human Liver Cell Line”;A study in a scientific journal suggests that the Pfizer mRNA “vaccine” can cause reverse transcription to DNA, which COVID “vaccine” apologists swore is impossible. The study, published in the MDPI journal, indicates that the mRNA sequences delivered by the vaccine can result in viral DNA fragments to be written to the human genome in human cells (in this case, liver cells). That this is even possible should be utterly alarming, but what is more shocking is that this is exactly what pro-”vaccine” public health officials all swore was impossible. These officials have been so consistently wrong about the science of the mRNA shots that either they are the least competent public health bureaucrats of all time, or they have deliberately suppressed and hidden all the possible adverse side-effects of the mRNA shot that are slowly emerging now.
2022-03-01;State of Wisconsin, Office of the Special Counsel: “Second Interim Investigative Report On the Apparatus & Procedures of the Wisconsin Elections System”;A report submitted to the Wisconsin legislature by the state’s Office of the Special Counsel outlines a number of irregularities and possible criminal conduct in the state’s execution of the 2020 election. The report puts forward 8 instances of serious irregularities. Most notable of these are the use of absentee ballot drop boxes without prior legislative approval, city governments providing private companies with unauthorized access to the WisVote database, nursing home residents casting votes with improper assistance and when ineligible to do so, and failure to include non-citizen in the WisVote database so that they can be properly denied a ballot (in accordance with state and federal law). The fact that election law was clearly violated numerous times and in a variety of ways, at the very minimum, leaves the door open to election fraud. Not only that, but instances of ballots being cast improperly have been forensically discovered. Whether this was done on a scale sufficient to influence the outcome of the state’s presidential election is not currently known. Even so, Democrats can no longer truthfully state that such an outcome is impossible. Democrats’ claims that the 2020 presidential election constitutes the most secure election ever held have been thoroughly shattered. 
2022-03-07;https://www.axios.com/trump-election-lawyers-disbar-5c2b9252-d15d-495f-a759-2446d9fa62e8.html;In retaliation for Trump’s lawyers exercising their legal right to challenge the 2020 election outcome in court, a “dark money” pro-Democrat group is trying to strip these lawyers of their ability to practice law. How is it not the most authoritarian thing imaginable to punish your opponents for using the law to challenge the result of your election victory by ensuring they can never challenge you again? This is the behavior of tyrants. And it certainly suggests that the election was not so legitimate as these same Democrats claim. If a party’s reaction to being challenged on the outcome of a presidential election in court, under laws firmly on the books, and surviving the challenge is to prevent those lawyers from ever practicing law again, then what are they so afraid of? This is not the behavior of a party secure in the knowledge that they won fair and square. And because, by definition, “dark money” means that donors cannot be identified, it is entirely possible that the funders are Democrats themselves. We are reaching a dangerous place where anyone who wants a fair recount against a Democrat win will be ejected from the electoral and legal process. Despots the world over cling to this very tactic: cheat to win, then destroy everyone who cried foul. The Democrats have definitely engaged in the second part of this, and it is unknown if they have or have not done so for the first. 
2022-03-08;https://twitter.com/ConceptualJames/status/1501202423032995840;Biden’s Surgeon General, a government employee bound by the constitution and its First Amendment, has issued guidance to Americans instructing them to help censor social media content which constitutes “misinformation” in his view regarding COVID. Once again, it should be noted that the Supreme Court has ruled that the government laundering censorship requests through the private sector is unconstitutional. The government cannot twist the arm of private companies to silence Americans when government, itself, may not do so. Otherwise what’s the point of the First Amendment? It’s interesting that the Surgeon General is stepping up his censorship campaign now that evidence abounds that the mRNA shot is ineffective against Omicron. Does anyone watching this administration really think that this censorship regime will not target evidence-based claims that the “vaccines” don’t work against Omicron? So then what anti-misinformation purpose is really being served here? Or is it an anti-Biden-criticism purpose?

2022-03-10;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1502079894339084288;Facebook has appointed itself the right to determine which nationalities users should be allowed to wish death upon, and which nationalities should be protected by their moderation policies. Facebook has exempted speech regarding Russians from its moderation policy against calling for the death of certain groups, in response to the Ukraine conflict. This is an extremely dangerous precedent to set, and one with no public oversight. Facebook is not a democracy on which all adults can vote. And as is well established from a view of FEC filings on campaign donations, the overwhelming majority of Facebook staffers support the Democrats. How does anyone think it’s OK to let a single highly partisan body to decide that certain groups should be subject to death threats? And of course, partisan bodies do enjoy such control, it is to the benefit of Democrats, as has been consistently the case for anyone gathering the evidence (at least when viewing the United States as a whole). The effect of this is that Democrat partisans, most of whom subscribe to the racist Critical Race Theory ideology in practice, decide who should suffer hate speech and who should not. 
2022-03-10;https://www.axios.com/inflation-february-cpi-fc5fec1f-2bb7-49b8-b9b5-7366c1de2bd3.html;Despite the Biden administration’s claim that inflation would soon subside, and that pandemic-related supply chain reductions are solely to blame, inflation has now risen to almost 8%. One of two things is clear: either Biden is deliberately pursuing policies which will jack up inflation and won’t admit it, or he is so incompetent that he has no idea how to stop it. Neither is acceptable, especially from someone who, as a candidate, claimed to have far superior understanding of the economy compared to Trump.
2022-03-11;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/jeff-zucker-cnn-resign-affair-cuomo-trump-1319698/;During the first months of the COVID pandemic, CNN colluded with a Democrat politician to help him improve his image and antagonize Trump. Gollust, the highest-level marketing and communications exec at CNN who previously worked for Andrew Cuomo, invited Cuomo onto CNN in order for him to respond favorably to pointed criticism by Trump. This is not mere conjecture. Text messages between the two, unearthed by a law firm in its review of CNN following Zucker’s scandalous departure, prove this to be the case. This incident yields yet more (and more concrete) evidence that the media is squarely backing the Democrats. This fact can no longer be denied. How is it, then, that the left is shocked that the right and independents no longer trust news which they know serves them (the left)?
2022-03-14;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1503468808094191618;A prominent CNN journalist is calling for the FBI to investigate another journalist and a former politician for suggesting that the US had a role in heightening tensions between Ukraine and Russia, and thus precipitating the war between them. Aside from the fact that the First Amendment protects Americans from government prosecution, regardless of what views they choose to express, it is completely legitimate to interrogate the US’s role in fomenting the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The idea that this journalist is advancing is essentially that, if you don’t agree with the federal government’s assessment of blame for certain geopolitical outcomes, you should be imprisoned. This is an extremely perilous view, especially for a journalist with national viewership, to advance. How can a nation be free if citizens are imprisoned for challenging that government’s views, regardless of how widely held they are among the masses? If this bedrock freedom is eroded, true democracy becomes impossible, as a legal sword will hang over any dissenters.
2022-03-15;https://twitter.com/0rf/status/1503840816837632000;A prominent Democrat-allied national media outlet branded a Biden critic’s repetition of a Biden administration official’s admission—under oath on the floor of Congress—of the existence of US-run biological research facilities in Ukraine as “propaganda”. Victoria Nuland, a member of the Biden administration, admitted before Congress that there are biological weapons facilities in Ukraine which the US has a hand in running. Yet when a critic of the president merely repeated this assertion, which in theory Americans have every reason to believe is true because it was uttered under oath, NBC labeled the claim as “far-right” “propaganda”. This is behavior befitting only despots: nominally independent, but allied, media entities refuting and condemning repetition of the regime’s own claims because they undermine the regime. 
2022-03-16;https://twitter.com/ColumbiaBugle/status/1504279122507448320;Yet another prominent media figure has called for the imprisonment of a sitting member of Congress who questions the wisdom of intervening further in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and risking a direct war between nuclear-armed states. Again, views like Olbermann’s endorse what amounts to criminalization of dissent from the government’s view, in just the same way as Russians are jailed for opposing the war. How can those who hold such views as this journalist claim any moral authority over Russia?
2022-03-17;https://greenwald.substack.com/p/the-nyt-now-admits-the-biden-laptop;The New York Times, a left-wing media entity, admitted that the Hunter Biden laptop contained authentic emails despite claims by most major media and multiple social networks that this was false when the New York Post first reported this fact. When the New York Post first reported on the emails contained on Hunter Biden’s laptop, media outlets rushed to characterizing it as Russian disinformation (or resembling it), and Facebook and Twitter (and likely others) prevented the story from circulating—censorship. Now a bastion of left-wing institutions, the New York Times, has finally conceded that it was true. This By definition, this means the suppression of the story constitutes election meddling by the journalistic and social media entities that participated in the denigration and suppression of the story, which could have swayed voters to vote for Trump had they been exposed to it. Is it any wonder why the right views the 2020 election as stolen? Would the left have viewed the 2020 election as NOT stolen had the media and social media suppressed a story critical of Trump and had Trump then won?

The Democrats accused Trump of being a pushover for Putin, despite the fact that Trump pushed to cancel the Germany-Russia Nord Stream 2 pipeline, advised Germany to end its dependence on Russian energy, and called for NATO members to dramatically step up their funding. But even if Trump HAD given way to Putin (which he clearly didn’t), how is a collapse of relations with Russia and a descent closer to war between nuclear-armed powers better than that? Should relations break down, it would be an extremely perilous development, as it would dramatically reduce our ability to reach a stable equilibrium between the US and Russia and avert a war. 
2022-03-21;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-60815547;Because the Biden administration antagonized Russia, and then responded to Russian aggression in Ukraine by calling for an end to purchases of Russian energy supplies, Russia-dependent European states are bridging the energy shortfall with more carbon-emitting fuel sources, thereby accelerating climate change. First of all, it is the fault of Biden’s most recent, most forceful push to integrate Russia neighbor Ukraine into the Western military-economic fabric which directly precipitated the Ukraine-Russia conflict in 2022. Russia has been clear in stating that it would not tolerate Ukraine’s absorption into the anti-Russian sphere of influence that is the EU and NATO. Despite this, every president since George W. Bush except Trump moved closer to admitting Ukraine into NATO. But it would appear from timing (quite convincingly) that Biden’s announcement of the US-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership on November 10, 2021, which calls to “deepen our strategic partnership”, is what pushed Russia to initiate its latest incursion into Ukraine. So the conflict which is causing European nations to satisfy their energy needs elsewhere can be directly tied to a move by Biden which Russia (not unreasonably) viewed as provocative. But then once the conflict touched off, it was Biden’s insistence that the world economically isolate Russia that caused European customers of Russian energy to turn to more carbon-emitting energy alternatives. In this way, it is fair to say that the acceleration in climate change which will ensue can be tied directly to Biden.
2022-03-24;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60868795;Now that is has been thoroughly proven that the Trump-Russia collusion accusation had no factual basis, Trump is moving to sue the Clinton for damaging his reputation. Not only was it known for years that the Democrats paid for the so-called “Steele dossier” on which the Trump-Russia collusion farce was based, but the FBI has since indicted the main source of the dossier’s contents,  Igor Danchenko, with lying to the FBI. To top it all off, it has also been proven that the Steele dossier, which was made up of fabricated claims, was then used as evidence for approving surveillance targeting Trump campaign figures. Given all of these facts, it is eminently reasonable and justifiable for Trump to sue the leader of the party that paid for the production of a false dossier that was then used to spy on his staffers. If the shoe was on the other foot—if the Republicans paid to create fake documents linking Clinton to Russia and then getting Clinton staffers targeted for surveillance based on those documents—Clinton would sue Trump, and rightly so. 
2022-03-25;https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1507257327484817408;Despite Biden’s assurances that he does not want to escalate tensions with Russia to risk the beginning of a new world war, Secretary of State Blinken has made no efforts to speak directly with Russian diplomats. How does this make any sense to any rational person? How can you engender understanding and restraint between your side and the other if you don’t even attempt dialog?This then begs the question: how committed is Biden to peace really? Either he isn’t, or he is so inept and reckless that he will shatter the peace by mistake.
2022-03-26;https://twitter.com/DowdEdward/status/1507763085225824257;Excess death numbers from the CDC for 2020 and 2021 show that excess deaths for the youngest age group (25-44 years of age) INCREASED by 47% from 2020 to 2021 despite the fact that vaccination rates were significantly higher in 2021 than in 2021 for that group (and all groups). Because the mRNA COVID “vaccine” was made available from older demographics to younger demographics, we know that vaccination rates among the 25-44 age group were low for most of 2020, as they were the last to become eligible. For about the first half of the year, the only Americans in this youngest age group to be offered vaccines were medical professionals and certain kinds of “essential workers”. In practice, the 25-44 age group had almost no vaccination levels until late spring/early summer 2020. By 2021, vaccination rates among the 25-44 group reached almost 3 in 4. So how is it possible that excess deaths in the youngest adults was GREATER in the second year of the pandemic, when almost 3 in 4 members of this group were vaccinated, than in the first year of the pandemic, when almost no one int his group was vaccinated? The most likely explanation is that this is because the mRNA “vaccine” isn’t very effective, with any benefit it may have granted this group outweighed by the fact that this group was the most likely to travel and socialize once they were vaccinated and felt invulnerable to COVID. The other strange phenomenon—strange, at least, if one believes that the mRNA jabs are as effective as their manufacturers and our public health officials profess—that the data shows is that excess deaths only went down by 13% from 2020 to 2021, from 592,000 to 512,000. If the mRNA “vaccine” is so effective, how come excess deaths only declined by 13%  from the year in which practically no Americans were vaccinated (2020) to the year where 60%+ Americans were vaccinated for the entire year (2021)? Again, the most likely explanation is that the COVID “vaccine” is just not that effective.
2022-03-27;https://twitter.com/JerryDunleavy/status/1508090991290601483;Biden’s approval ratings have slipped even further, to the point where only 40% of Americans approve of his job as president overall, and only 28% approve of his handling of Ukraine. How incompetent does a leader have to be to have less than 3 in 10 people approve of their handling a conflict with the potential to initiate nuclear war? It should be extremely difficult to have that little of Americans’ faith on an issue with such immense and terrifying potential consequences. All of this is against a backdrop in which the same people who voted for Biden swore that it was Trump who would have gotten us into a nuclear war. 
2022-03-27;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-60895392;Even the liberal media is pointing out how dangerous Biden’s off-the-cuff call for the overthrow of Putin was. At the end of his NATO speech in Poland, Biden called for Putin, the leader of a nuclear-armed state currently in high tensions with the West, to be removed from power. This is dangerous for obvious reasons, those reasons being that the US is not only known for ruthlessly pursuing regime change since the start of the Cold War, but the US DID successfully overthrow the Yanukovych government in Ukraine in 2014 by backing the Maidan movement. So Putin has every reason to believe that when the US calls for his removal, it is serious. What other reaction could Putin possibly have than to take that as a serious threat?
2022-03-27;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-60891803;Biden’s casual call for Putin’s overthrow (see above) was so dangerous that the US State Department had to immediately walk it back lest tensions between nuclear-armed Russia and the West escalate further. What does it say about the stability and tact of a leader when they make an impromptu remark that’s so dangerous that his own administration has to backpedal for him?
2022-03-27;https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1508047812134645763;France’s president, Macron, has also added his voice to the chorus of criticism of Biden’s overly inflammatory remarks aimed at Putin. Macron made the point that calling Putin a “butcher” is not conducive to deescalating tensions and opening the door to a peaceful negotiation of an end to the conflict in Ukraine. On this, Macron is undoubtedly correct.
2022-03-28;https://www.axios.com/poll-americans-russia-sanctions-ukraine-war-149976a7-9a4d-4cff-9a40-d102cc44f904.html;Despite the Democrats’ (and some Republicans’) calls to escalate tensions with Russia by imposing a no-fly zone over Ukraine, most Americans do not want to go to war with Russia. It would seem that only the Democrats are obsessed with blaming Russia for their domestic political defeat and giving Russia a black eye as payback. If the Democrats made such a convincing case that Russia tipped the scale in favor of one presidential candidate over another—which most Americans regardless of party would treat as a brazen and unacceptable affront if proven convincingly—then why is it that so few Americans are interested in a war with Russia? Yes, it is true that many Republicans are so rapidly partisan that they would not express any concern if it were the case that Russia had helped Trump win, a claim for which there is no evidence. But a good number of Republicans would condemn this (rightly), and practically all Democrats and independents would as well. So the fact that Americans don’t want the war the Democrats are pushing suggests that Americans don’t buy the narrative that Russia decided the election for Trump. And why should they? As stated earlier, the Trump-Russia collusion story is dead, exposed as a fake by the very indictment for perjury of the individual who compiled the document that launched the investigation into said supposed collusion. To Biden’s credit, he has publicly stated that he will firmly resist calls to enter the Russia-Ukraine conflict. But to his criticism, Biden has shot off his mouth with dangerously provocative remarks in the last couple of weeks. So conflict is very much still possible. 
2022-03-28;https://www.axios.com/judge-trump-eastman-documents-jan-6-committee-8fe17985-75eb-4c28-a51e-b74760def3ec.html;A pro-Democrat judge leverages his position (and associated credibility) to make sweeping, unproven, (in a court of law) condemnatory claims that Trump attempted a “coup” on January 6, 2021. The judge, David Carter, ordered that a lawyer acting in Trump’s interests surrender documents associated with the Capitol Riot. This in itself is not objectionable, as the judge was carrying out the legal judgment in regards to the case before him. However, Carter then used the case to opine on the motive and nature of the actions of Trump in regards to the events of January 6, 2021. This is an overstep, indeed an abuse, of his judicial authority. Judges have no place making criminal accusations, or pronouncing guilt, from the bench. Not only that, but the pronouncements Carter made are self-contradictory and have no rational basis. He stated that Trump instigated “a coup in search of a legal theory”. This is nonsensical. Coups require no legal theory—they are by their very nature, illegal. A coup wields pure force to end the legal regime of one government and impose a new one. Furthermore, if a party pursues a legal theory, and seeks to secure a change in election outcome through the courts, then this is by definition not a coup. If the law allows for an election challenge, then it cannot be considered illegal to pursue such a challenge. Hence, by stating that Trump’s coup sought a legal justification is to smear a legitimate recourse as criminal and treasonous, a dangerous and undemocratic practice. Carter in fact criticizes the pursuit of legal theories in general, as though he is unaware as a judge that every argument in court which succeeds and sets a precedent begins as a legal theory. The attempted acceptance of legal theories is the bedrock of our legal system, allowing it to evolve to fit the changing mores and needs of our society. Additionally, Carter accuses Trump of attempting to “overturn a democratic election, an action unprecedented in American history”. But if we are to take Carter’s own line of argumentation, wasn’t the Democrats’ Supreme Court challenge of Bush’s victory over Gore the exact same thing? No party gets to have it both ways: either seeking a change in election results through the courts is acceptable regardless of which party is the author (the legally-consistent and democratic perspective), or it is unacceptable regardless of party. Worse, not only does a supposedly impartial judge bias his views in favor of the Democrats, but he lies in the process. He claims that Capitol Riot “led to the deaths of several law enforcement officers” but this is false. There is no evidence, neither medical reports nor video evidence nor reliable witness testimony nor conviction in a court of law, to suggest that any rioters killed any law enforcement personnel. At most, with an immense stretch in semantics, one could claim that the “attacks” on the Capitol building “led to” the death of Officer Sicknick in the sense that the event directly preceded his death by natural means. The working theory behind is death is that, since Sicknick survived the event and went home, only to die days later not by apparent suicide, that the stress of the event exacerbated some underlying health condition which ultimately killed him. Considering Carter’s remarks in this light, it becomes inescapably clear that he sought to use his position to bias future legal proceedings surrounding the Capitol Riot against Trump, an extremely perilous precedent to set in our legal system.
2022-03-30;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1509160069514027010;Democrat lapdog entertainer Colbert, who famously (and commendably) ridiculed journalists for fawning over the president, used his immense platform to state that journalists who question Biden should be slapped. So, just like with every Democrat, rules and standards are only for their opponents: questioning Republicans is the patriotic and essential task of journalists, but questioning Democrats merits physically violent reprisal. 
2022-03-31;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60936468;Biden releases the most petroleum ever from the US’s Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the purely partisan aim of lowering gas prices which he is responsible for increasing and cushioning the Democrats’ likely election defeats in the 2022 midterms. This supply is intended to equip the US military to operate in the event of an extremely dire threat to the nation in which oil is not readily available. So by drawing down the supply, he is making the nation less secure and insulated from oil embargoes, solely to help his party in an election. This is simply unacceptable: no party should be able to use the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to lower civilian gas prices, or for any other partisan purpose. But for the Democrats, there is no lever of power they won’t use to serve their own ends. Ironically, considering they accuse the Republicans of this, the Democrats put party above country, yet another case of psychological projection. 
2022-04-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1509893308675407882;A journalist on CNN admitted that the supposedly missing 7 hours of White House phone call records likely has a mundane and legitimate explanation, rather than the nefarious one CNN and other Democrat-subservient media have concocted. Once again, Trump conspiracy fever dreams drummed up by the media faithful to the Democrats falls apart upon minimal scrutiny. This episode is remarkable only for how quickly the fabrication fell apart.
