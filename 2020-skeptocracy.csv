2020-10-31;https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32871846/;Despite the government’s official criticism of, and discouragement from, using ivermectin as a COVID treatment, the NIH itself published a study indicating that ivermectin binds to the same receptor, ACE2, which the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein does, blocking the virus from binding at those sites. If the NIH knew that ivermectin held promise as a COVID treatment, as their publication clearly suggests, why did they instruct doctors not to use it? Why did the NIH allow the media to brand claims of ivermectin’s effectiveness against COVID as “misinformation” and for social media to censor these claims? Why would an organization that cares about people’s health actively steer medical professionals away from this drug?
2020-11-25;https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1331673582930440193;Democrats were openly hypocritical on the danger of faithless electors. Democrats raged at the idea suggestion that electors committed to Biden might switch their votes to Trump (faithless electors), screaming that this would undermine democracy. But in 2016, they advocated doing the exact same thing, but to their benefit.
2020-12-05;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1335340441726820353 ;Democrat-allied media advanced the delusion that Biden “as a rule, doesn’t lie.” However, even to that point (2020-12-04), Biden lied about marching with Mandela, among many other untruths.
2020-12-08;https://twitter.com/TomBevanRCP/status/1336286507255160835;A prominent Democrat apologist implies it’s only acceptable for Democrats to question elections. After the 2020 election, Paul Krugman cast Republicans as deluded for challenging whether or not the 2020 election was rigged, but he outright proclaimed that the election was rigged in 2016 (when Democrats lost to Trump).
2020-12-09;https://twitter.com/aaronjmate/status/1336769475924865033;YouTube only censors anti-Democrat conspiracies, but lets anti-Republican conspiracies live on. In December 2020, YouTube began removing videos suggesting Trump was the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. However, they have not implemented any comparable censorship (by all appearances, none whatsoever) targeting conspiracies suggesting that Trump is a Russian asset, or that the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. 
2020-12-16;https://twitter.com/ben_awareness/status/1339293381625864195;Instagram censors an anti-Biden meme, and tries to pass it off as fact-checking. Am Instagram user made a meme criticizing Biden for authoring federal crime legislation in 1994 which had dramatic repercussions for the black community. Instagram subsequently removed the post, which featured no factual inaccuracies, under the auspices of its fact-checking policies. 
2020-12-22;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1341419523354865664;During the election, Biden promised he would expand asylum quotas to pre-Trump levels, but by the transition period, it appeared he no longer had any intention of doing so. The dissonance between Biden’s campaign promise and his policy objectives is proof that he is willing to pose as more humane than his opponents, but then do nothing to actually govern more humanely. 
2020-12-27;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1343183962768891908;Silicon Valley is overwhelmingly pro-Democrat, and the money proves it. Donations from employees of large companies to Biden are 20 times donations from those same employees to Trump. 
2020-12-27;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1343316210566508544;SJW culture encourages students to police each other for transgressions against PC speech dictates. Teenagers do stupid things and are irreverent, but that doesn’t mean they are bad people, and it certainly doesn’t mean that they deserve to have their futures ruined. But teenagers today (Gen Z) are encouraged to not only report when their friends express anything that deviates from Woke dogma, but to do using recorded text threads, videos, and other digital media. 
2020-12-30;https://twitter.com/mtracey/status/1344349659431645185;When Republicans mount impotent protests to the Electoral College certification, it’s fascist, but when Democrats do the same, not even a whimper of protest. When some Republicans said they would submit a formal protest to the Electoral College vote count, Democrats cried that democracy was being eroded. But Democrats did just this in the wake of George W. Bush’s election and no one made any insinuations that these Democrats were undemocratic.
