2023-01-01;https://nypost.com/2023/01/01/illinois-high-court-halts-law-that-would-eliminate-cash-bail;law enforcement;Democrats in Illinois are not only trying to amend criminal law to allow anyone arrested for anything short of murder to roam free, but they are violating the state constitution to do so. The Illinois Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling stating that the law abolishing most forms of cash bail unconstitutionally stripped power from the judiciary. Why are the Democrats so hell-bent on giving criminals license to act with impunity? 
2023-01-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1609619937491828737;authoritarianism;Despite Democrats’ insistence that Trump’s tax returns hid Russia collusion and self-enrichment, the documents show that he did not receive any suspicious funds from Russia and that he actually LOST money during his presidency. It turns out the Democrats are willing to spread any unsubstantiated slander against their opponents, which their loyal media lapdogs eagerly repeat without scrutinizing it one iota. This is just more proof that, unless the Democrats have hard data or evidentiary documents backing up their claims, they should be rejected immediately. Of course, the reputational damage has already been done, which is what the Democrats were counting on. They’ve figured out that the most effective form of character assassination and political hit jobbing is to make claims that take so long to investigate (even when there is appetite to do so immediately) that the public opinion the claims were meant to sway has served its usefulness. And these are the kind of people who think they deserve our trust?
2023-01-03;https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1610372376792891395;authoritarianism;Congress and the intelligence community pressured Twitter to ban whatever accounts they wanted banned. In yet another Twitter Files report, internal Twitter documents show that in the year following the 2016 election, Democrats in congress piled on pressure to coerce Twitter into carrying out their desired censorship activities. This is further proof of the government’s unconstitutional behavior: in breach of First Amendment case law, the government used its power to coerce the private sector into silencing voices the government disliked. First Amendment protections apply even to foreigners on US soil. So even if the accounts in question were operated by Russians residing outside of the US, the fact that their content was hosted on US-based servers would seem to protect it under the First Amendment. Is this potentially inconvenient to US national security? Yes. But the law is the law, and erosion of that law leads down a dangerous path where the First Amendment holds no force to protect anyone. The Democrats, of course, are only too happy to skip merrily down that path, because then it opens the door to censoring the political right. They have proved this time and time again, as this document clearly proves. 
2023-01-04;https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.061025;COVID;A study published in the peer-reviewed journal of the American Heart Association shows a correlation between patients who developed myocarditis in connection with the mRNA COVID immune therapy and the presence of free-floating spike proteins, which the manufacturers assured us all would never happen. Medical professionals applying healthy, reason-based, scientific skepticism warned that spike proteins produced by means of the COVID “vaccines” might break off and circulate freely in the bloodstream. These same rational, well-credentialed experts further warned that, because the spike proteins are cytotoxic (i.e. damaging to cells), there may be adverse health effects associat4ed with free-floating spike proteins (and, by extension, the “vaccines”). Public health figures and the media denied all this, insisting that to even raise the question was to disseminate “disinformation”. Now here we are with studies that back up EXACTLY what these responsible skeptics of the mRNA COVID immune therapy had been forewarning. If public health officials, (Democrat) politicians, and (pro-Democrat) media had everyone’s best interests in mind, why did they silence these skeptics? If they simply believed that COVID was more dangerous than “vaccine” side-effects, why didn’t they just say so outright and provide the evidence to back it up? Why did they instead resort right to demonization and censorship? Is this the behavior of leaders and experts who are “just looking out for you”?
2023-01-04;https://twitter.com/CoriBush/status/1610726873792929792;authoritarianism;Democrats make racist remarks about black Republicans for daring to defy the Democratic Party. Cori Bush essentially said that Republican Byron Donalds, a black Republicans elected to the House, was an unthinking pawn of the Republicans with no agency of his own. How is this not racist, to suggest that a black man couldn’t possibly align with the Republicans of his own free will and critical faculties? It also implies that Republicans would never willingly support a black man for Speaker, which would have been a first in US history, another racist insinuation. Once again, the Democrats show themselves to be the real racist party in America. The Republicans are happy to include and platform black voices, and the Democrats deny the agency of every single one of those black voices. 
2023-01-05;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9813456/pdf/431_2022_Article_4786.pdf;COVID;Yet another peer reviewed scientific study has been published showing dangerous side effects for the COVID mRNA immune therapy shot: this one states that adolescents who receive a second dose experience serious cardiac symptoms, which progress into full-fledged cardiac conditions like myocarditis 0.1% of the time. This reveals one of two lies that were knowingly told to the public during an unprecedented crisis. The first possibility is that the government lied that the COVID “vaccines” were safe when the FDA reviewed the data and knew that there were serious side effects for children. The second possibility is that the government lied that they had thorough and transparent data from the drug companies and approved the shots anyway (but at least were telling the truth when they said they didn’t think there were side effects). And keep in mind that a 0.1% rate of myocarditis is still 1-in-1000 children getting a permanent damage to their hearts, which is not a small number of children considering the millions who were administered doses. So regardless, the government lied to Americans one way or another, and it resulted in children suffering permanent damage to their hearts when the rate of COVID deaths for children is hundreds of times smaller of a risk. Every official party to this lie who didn’t speak out should face prison time. 
2023-01-06;https://www.axios.com/2023/01/06/jan6-second-anniversary-speaker-vote;authoritarianism;Democrats are linking the January 6 Riot, which they equate to a treasonous coup, to duly-elected Republicans’ contentious vote for their Speaker of the House. How is this anything other than authoritarian? Imagine if Republicans connected a messy vote for a Democrat House Speaker to the Floyd Riots? The Democrats would throw a fit, and their outrage (though maybe not the childish temper tantrum-like manner in which they would express it) would be justified. And yet the Democrats freely liken Republicans voting for their leader as they see fit, as is their legal right, with what they (the Democrats) would like us to believe was an armed insurrection to end the republic. It’s ironic that the Democrats have anointed themselves as the guardians of democracy when no party has more contempt for democracy than the Democrats. They couldn’t stand Trump winning in 2016 fair and square, and made up an entire hoax about him colluding with Russia. And now the Democrats can’t even handle Republicans gaining control over one-half of one branch of government without insinuating that these Republicans are traitors. Likening your legitimately elected political opponents to traitors is the behavior of tyrants, pure and simple. 
2023-01-09;https://twitter.com/AlexBerenson/status/1612526697038897167, https://alexberenson.substack.com/p/from-the-twitter-files-pfizer-board;corruption;At the behest of a Pfizer board member, Twitter suppressed a tweet featuring scientifically accurate information that criticized the efficacy of the COVID mRNA immune therapy “vaccine”. The tweet, tweeted out by a doctor who formerly headed the FDA, made the scientifically factual statement that natural immunity was significantly more effective at combating COVID than the mRNA “vaccines”. But because this obviously threatens Pfizer’s COVID jab profits, Pfizer made sure to get subservient social media companies to suppress the actual scientific truth, ensuring that scared Americans continued to erroneously believe that the jab was their best bet against COVID. Pfizer and Twitter colluded to misinform Americans during a deadly global pandemic, all to increase their profits. Everyone responsible should be put on trial and imprisoned for the rest of their days. Interesting that Democrats, who collectively receive millions from the pharmaceutical industry, championed exactly the same kind of censorship that Pfizer did. 
2023-01-09;https://www.axios.com/2023/01/09/biden-classified-records-national-archives;corruption;Biden, who sent the FBI to raid Trump’s home for keeping classified documents after leaving office, was found to have improperly taken classified documents to a private office after stepping down as Vice President. On top of the obvious hypocrisy, there is a key difference here. Whereas when Trump retained sensitive materials he was president, meaning he is a classification origin and can thus can declassify any document at his discretion, Biden was Vice President—which is not a classification origin—at the time at which he retained classified materials past his term. This means that whereas Trump did not break the law, Biden definitely did. This is not defending Trump’s actions as being a good idea. They weren’t. But it was at least not illegal. Biden’s actions, on the other hand, were just as bad AND unequivocally illegal. But of course, because federal law enforcement skews left, there is no way there will be raids of Biden’s homes. Nor will Biden offer Trump anything in the way of an apology for his glaring hypocrisy. The talking points in the Democrat-bootlicking media will continue to be that what Trump did was worse, even though from a legal standpoint it’s not. How is this not yet another item of proof that the system is biased for the left? 
2023-01-09;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1612651092063490048;authoritarianism;In an irony clearly lost on this individual, a so-called journalist is calling Taibbi, who exposed government pressure on Twitter to censor dissenters, “authoritarian”. What is more authoritarian than coming to the defense of a government that coerced communications platforms into silencing peaceful critics of that government, in violation of that government’s own constitutional enshrinement of civil liberties? And it bears reminding that this government, in all the roles and offices responsible for this authoritarian political persecution and censorship, was controlled by Democrats or their sympathizers. Defending or siding with the authoritarians—in America, the left—makes you the authoritarian, not the people criticizing it. This is the warped world these people live in, though. They use the synchronized state and corporate power to silence and ostracize their foes, and then have the audacity to call those foes the authoritarians. This is the classic tactic of tyrants the world over: convince their people that their enemies are the “real” authoritarians. The media establishment is rife with these Goebbels wannabes. 
2023-01-09;https://twitter.com/houmanhemmati/status/1612635584539033603;identity;USC’s school of Social Work will now no longer use the world “field” because they erroneously believe that this term is somehow exclusively used in the context of American chattel slavery. The word “field” has nothing to do with slavery. It describes literally an open, flat expanse of plants or crops. It is also very commonly used to mean “discipline” or “area of study”. This is not controversial. Yet in the interest of virtue signaling, and policing language (the left’s favorite pastime), USC is making this word controversial. The aim is control. With the left, it always is. They warp and twist the meanings of words so that they can “gotcha” their opponents, call them “fascists”, and then use state power to crush these supposed “fascists”. This seemingly inane move is, thus, actually quite dangerous. Why do we tolerate this? 
2023-01-10;https://www.heritage.org/gender/event/detransitioner-talks-protecting-children-gender-medicine;identity;Those who were formerly transgender as children are now speaking out that doctors pushed them to transition, without any words of caution. In some cases, these trans children are now suing doctors for medical malpractice, for taking advantage of their social awkwardness and teenage growing pains to steer them toward a treatment they would ultimately regret. With every other treatment, doctors will walk patients through the pros and cons of all treatment options. But because many doctors want to use their practice as a vehicle for virtue signaling, they do not do this with sex change procedures for treating so-called “gender dysphoria”. Instead, these doctors tell children—children—that transitioning is the only option, and that failing to do so would lead them to despair and death. How is it that children are considered developmentally incapable of every other kind of adult consent or responsibility—driving, joining the military, using legal substances, etc.—but are yet somehow considered mature enough to consent to, and undergo, sex change procedures? What adults choose to do to their own body is their business, and no one has the right to stop them. But children do not have the cognitive maturity to consent to doing so, a principle which is long-standing in every other regard. Who decided that transgender transitioning is the exception to this? What scientific evidence is there that sex change procedures is the ONE thing children are capable of consenting to? 
2023-01-10;https://twitter.com/greg_price11/status/1612925788931637248;authoritarianism;In a nation founded on the idea that the citizens have inalienable rights against the power abuses of the state, the allegedly freedom-loving Democrats all voted against the formation of a House committee for investigating the “weaponization of the federal government”. What reason could Democrats have to not be interested in uncovering ways in which the government has been weaponized against Americans? What are they afraid that such a committee will find? We have already gotten a taste of how the Democrats have weaponized the government, the Twitter Files presenting only a few of a great many examples. This is the kind of investigation that should receive a “yea” vote from every single member of the House. Stopping government abuse of power requires constant vigilance. Democrats, however, don’t seem to be interested in keeping watch against abuses. Every Democrat should have to tell the American people EXACTLY why. 
2023-01-10;https://www.thecollegefix.com/harvard-med-class-focuses-on-lgbtqia-infants-and-older/;identity;According to the description of a course available at Harvard Medical School, infants can somehow identify as LGBT. Anyone familiar with infants should be able to tell you that infants can’t identify as anything. They have not reached a stage of human development where they are even self-aware or capable of speech. And one should easily be able to reason that prepubescent children, who are therefore not sexually mature (from a purely biological reproductive standpoint), can’t express their sexual preferences—they don’t have any. Infants are also not aware of their own gender (and, again, cannot speak or think in abstract terms like “gender”), so they can’t be transgender by definition. How is it that professors at one of the world’s most prestigious schools is unaware of this basic biological fact? More to the point, is it that this instructor is not aware, or chooses to deliberately ignore this fact? Could it be that ideology is taking precedence over reality in the case of this instructor? I thought the left didn’t tolerate misinformation. I guarantee this professor isn’t a conservative. 
2029-01-11;https://www.maryannforraleigh.com/, https://www.wral.com/raleigh-police-chief-addresses-increase-in-crime-access-to-firearms/20667882/;law enforcement;As Raleigh’s Democrat mayor prioritizes an “inclusive, welcoming, and equitable city”, violent crime has reached all-time record levels in that city. Democrats love to focus on their diversity hiring virtue signaling optics while letting the quality of life for all citizens under their rule disintegrate into nothing. To Democrats, it is more important to make racially biased hiring decisions than it is to ensure citizens are safe, in the name of racial justice, of course. And just which groups are harmed most by increases in violent crime? Oh, that’s right, the exact racial minorities they claim to be so diligently helping. So in totality, Democrats’ “racial justice” policies not only make the city worse for everyone, but they impose particularly devastating suffering on the races they so ardently seek justice for. Interesting how these policies actually turn out. It’s almost like Democrats are the real racist party in this country, which they have been since the Civil War. 
2023-01-11;https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/09/business/gas-stove-ban-federal-agency/index.html, https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-led-cities-already-moving-forward-gas-stove-bans-affect-millions, https://thehill.com/homenews/nexstar_media_wire/3620612-why-cities-are-banning-gas-stoves/;authoritarianism;Because Biden doesn’t have the votes to support his administration’s policy banning gas stoves, he’s counting on his Democrat allies to impose the ban for him. This is a new sinister tactic the Democrats are embracing to force their policies on Americans. A Democrat president will “consider” a radical policy that he knows will never be passed by congress, and which he can’t get away with decreeing. Then lower-level Democrats in states and cities will read that as a signal for THEM to implement the policy for him. And because nearly all cities in America over 100,000 people are run by Democrats (and have been for decades), this allows Democrats to issue decrees which affect the vast majority of Americans without any vote taking place. This is absolutely a mechanism of authoritarian control the likes of which would make the founders of our nation roll over in their graves. To the Democrats, getting their way is more important than Americans having the freedom to choose the laws they want to live under. The Democrats truly believe that we are too stupid to have a right to decide our own fates, that they have to save us from ourselves. That is as antithetical to freedom as one can get. 
2023-01-12;https://www.axios.com/2023/01/12/chamber-of-commerce-business-address-washington;economy;According to the US Chamber of Commerce, American businesses are “fed up” with how Biden is running the economy. Biden swore he would be so much better for the economy than Trump. How does Biden explain that business owners across the country have little faith in him? And why is it that small businesses have closed at record rates in Democrat-controlled states, but not Republican-controlled states, during the pandemic? The inflation caused by the Democrats and exacerbated by Biden definitely hasn’t been good for businesses. I’m sure businesses owners across the nation would love to know how Biden plans to help them for a change. 
2023-01-12;https://www.axios.com/2023/01/12/biden-classified-documents-white-house;national security;Biden has confirmed reported claims by an anonymous source that he improperly removed a second cache of classified documents, this time at his personal residence. These documents were stored in his garage. So not only has Biden broken the law by retaining his documents where Trump did not, but Biden has also proven to be so careless as to leave documents scattered in random places he can’t even keep track of. How is this so much more responsible than Trump? If Biden had Trump’s home raided for keeping documents he is legally allowed to, the consequences ought to be that much more severe for Biden. But what are the chances of that? We all know the government, with bureaucracies staffed by Democrat supporters, will never do anything to Biden. Federal law enforcement will just let high-placed Democrats handle sensitive national security documents carelessly while throwing the book at Trump. One of these days (if not already) America is going to suffer dearly for the theft of documents mishandled by Democrats. Only then will we fully suffer for their arrogance and stupidity. 
2023-01-12;https://twitter.com/MIAuniverse/status/1613432016426643459;identity;A racial minority artist is being canceled, her livelihood destroyed, for daring to so much as have a public conversation with a conservative (who is also a racial minority). The left claims they love racial minorities, so why are they destroying one’s career? Isn’t that, by their own definition, racist? The answer is the left is the racist political faction in our country, and they never cared about racial minorities. Racial minorities are just a political prop for the left so that their mostly white, mostly wealthy leaders can ascend to power. And they won’t think twice about, let alone see the hypocrisy in, destroying the image and career of a racial minority who gets in their way, who dares to see through the ruse and warn the rest of us. 
2023-01-12;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64252574;national security;The Biden classified document breach is so bad that the Justice Department can’t get away with not investigating it. The Democrats wanted to let this just be a PR hit. But literally Biden is so sloppy and such a national security risk, that they have to appoint a special counsel to investigate him, lest the facade of an impartial justice system slip too far. You know it’s bad when Democrats know they can’t get away with suffering no consequences for their actions. 
2023-01-12;https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrat-suggests-classified-docs-bidens-home-office-planted-second-batch-found;authoritarianism;Elected Democrats are now putting forward the unhinged and unfounded conspiracy theory that Republicans planted classified documents in Biden’s various residences and offices in order to make him look bad. Don’t the Democrats insist that they are the anti-conspiracy theory party, that they’re the party of truth? What business does such a party have in floating completely unsupported theories like this? When Trump was raided for retaining sensitive documents, none of the Republicans denied that he did so. None of them suggested the Democrats planted documents on him to provide a pretext for a raid on his home. They simply argued that (1) Trump had the legal right to do so as president (which is factually accurate, as the president is a classification origin), and (2) that it wasn’t a big deal that he did so (a point that reasonable people can debate). But as soon as a Democrat makes the same mistake they blasted Trump for, they concoct some absurd conspiracy theory because they just can’t accept that their party makes mistakes, too. But this is worse than Democrats refusing to accept that their side is just as cavalier with classified documents (actually, more so). This conspiracy is a casual accusation of serious illegality by the Republicans. This is all part of Democrats’ plan to slowly ratchet up their accusations of Republican lawbreaking to justify arraying federal law enforcement against them. The Democrats as a whole believe the Republicans are bigoted domestic terrorists, and that the Republican party should be outlawed on US soil. Every little casual accusation like this inches them closer to ending the Republican party, and therefore silencing all viable opposition to their rule. 
2023-01-12;https://twitter.com/mtaibbi/status/1613589031773769739;authoritarianism;Democrats in congress knowingly lied to Americans in claiming Russian disinformation ops boosted the spread of certain anti-Democrat hashtags, even when Twitter personnel informed them in private that these hashtags were trending organically (i.e. from legitimate user activity). Isn’t it interesting that the party that claims to oppose disinformation so strongly is the one spreading it the most? Democrats literally claimed their opposition’s social media activity was fake even when Twitter told these Democrats that wasn’t true. Not only that, but the media, ever the loyal servants of the Democrats, ran with this. And of course, Twitter ultimately rolled over because they love the Democrats, letting the Democrats spread their lies. How can anyone trust a party willing to lie to Americans, saying that their opponents’ online speech was fake, and that has a subservient media class that will cover the lie? This is the stuff of totalitarian states: lying leaders and media that spreads the lie rather than exposes it. 
2023-01-13;https://www.npr.org/2023/01/13/1148966968/sarah-huckabee-sanders-arkansas-latinx;identity;The left is outraged that Hucakbee Sanders is protecting Spanish heritage in Arkansas by banning the use of “Latinx” and other culturally effacing terms fabricated by the left. How is it not racist for the left, which is mostly not of Latin-American ancestry or culture, to dictate the course of Latin culture and heritage to fit their political agenda? Spanish uses gendered nouns. This is a fact, and one that Latinos accept. They are proud of their culture, as well they should be. How Is it at all objectionable for the government of Arkansas to respect that culture? If anything, it is more racially sensitive, just, and inclusive for the government to characterize groups the way they characterize themselves. The left does this when they use Native American tribes’ actual names, not the names ascribed to them by ignorant European settlers in the Americas. But because the gendered nouns of Spanish chafe against their radical campaign to erase gender yet somehow also insist on it strongly, the left can’t respect the wishes of ethnic minority cultures. So which side is REALLY the racists, the one that calls people what they call themselves (the right), or the one that dictate to ethnic minorities how they must construct their language (the left)? 
2023-01-13;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1614423013235068935;authoritarianism;Democrats are insinuating that a real journalist who exposed their lies is working to advance Russian interests. The Democrats are literally smearing their enemies as being agents of hostile foreign entities and traitors... for exposing Democrats’ lies. Taibbi notes that internal Twitter documents repeatedly show that the Democrats made claims about Russian disinformation campaigns even when the evidence contradicted such claims. Democrat Lieu replies that indicting 12 Russian intelligence officials, who will never set foot in an American courtroom from now until the day they die, somehow proves that Russian disinformation campaigns were real. Taibbi, rationally, makes this exact point. Lieu then, for some inexplicable and puzzling leap in logic, cites the dropping of charges against 2 of these cases to supposedly prevent the exposure of US intelligence sources as though this also proves that Russian disinformation was real. This is also the point at which Lieu implies that Taibbi, an American journalist holding the powerful accountable, is a traitor. This is the tactic of authoritarians the world over: baselessly accuse their political opponents of being enemies of the state. A truly free nation cannot suffer leaders who respond to valid criticism by smearing their critics as traitors. 
2023-01-13;https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23579495/hunters-capitol-spoliation-order-1-13-23.pdf ;authoritarianism;Seattle city officials deleted thousands of text messages related to their handling of the Antifa CHAZ protests, in flagrant violation of a judge’s legal order mandating that these messages be preserved. If the city’s handling of the crisis—in which Antifa wrested control of sovereign US territory away from the duly elected democratic government—was above board, if they earnestly did their best, then why are they deleting messages? What is the Seattle government, filled top to bottom with Democrats (as if that needs to be spelled out), trying to hide? And how is it that Democrats can violate a judge’s order and claim to believe in the sanctity of the law? The Democrats have regard for neither the law, peace, nor freedom, and will do whatever it takes to bury the evidence. 
2023-01-14;https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/us-says-pfizers-bivalent-covid-shot-may-be-linked-stroke-older-adults-2023-01-13/;COVID;Studies are now showing a possible link between the COVID mRNA immune therapy shot and stroke. How is this the “totally safe” “vaccine” we were all assured it was? COVID shot manufacturers and their public health thralls either swore there were no long-term negatives side effects (which they could not possibly know because the shot had only been out for less than 2 years), or insisted that we shouldn’t worry about possible side effects because there is no way they can be as bad as COVID (which the jab didn’t even prevent). If people knew that the “vaccine” meant possibly suffering a stroke while barely decreasing the risk of COVID infection, which has a fraction of a percent chance of killing you, does anyone think most people would have taken the treatment? How is risking stroke for next to zero reduction in COVID risk considered an “effective” treatment at all? Here’s something else worth thinking about: in that trove of pharmaceutical-provided testing data the government agreed to withhold from FOIA requests for 80 years, I wonder if there’s anything in there about stroke risk? Maybe there is, and maybe there isn’t. But evidence has already come out showing that either obvious testing scenarios were never considered, and that the manufacturers were aware of some side-effects that they withheld from the public. So who knows? 
2023-01-14;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-64270906;national security;Reporters have confirmed that the trove of Biden’s improperly stored documents were top secret, meaning extremely sensitive to national security.

2023-01-14;https://twitter.com/TaylerUSA/status/1614475709019217920;identity;Democrats attended a Dallas “all ages” drag show in which performers mentioned sexually explicit acts. Democrats don’t see anything wrong with letting children see grown adults dancing in a sexually provocative manner and singing about blowjobs. Children aren’t allowed in bars or strip clubs,  yet somehow this is acceptable to Democrats? It was one thing for Democrats to allow this to occur without comment, but now they have proven beyond doubt that hey endorse this conduct. These Democrats didn’t have to attend, but they went out of their way to affirmatively state that, yes, they think children should be allowed a shows with this kind of sexually explicit content. Also, it’s interesting that these Democrats had nothing negative to say about the leftist terrorists openly brandishing the AR-15s that Democrats say they want to ban from every state in the nation. I wonder why Democrats didn’t speak out against the wielding of these “assault weapons” that are “weapons of war” and supposedly should not be legal for anyone to own. Oh, wait, I think I know the reason why... The Democrats are fine with the left—including an organization that has taken over parts of American cities and assaulted peaceful citizens—having “weapons of war”, but as soon the right asserts its right to own these very same weapons, the Democrats have a meltdown. Let that sink in, the Democrats think they have the right to brutally kill anyone who doesn’t want children exposed to sexually explicit content, but they think you don’t have the right to arm yourself to protect your own life and property as they unleash violent criminals. The Democrats hate anyone who opposes them (and even many of their own supporters), and prefer if their opponents were dead.

How is it that Democrats tolerate this? How is this not staggeringly offensive to the party that supposedly values racial justice above all other policy objectives? It is hard to think of more racially insensitive things to do than for a white leader to lie about his work to fight racism on a day dedicated to an actual, deserving civil rights hero. This is how you know that the Democrats are the racist party in America: they think race is some prop they can just play with as they see fit, including by outright lying if they so desire.

In response to the discovery of classified documents at Biden’s personal residence, Republicans have called for Biden to make visitors logs public, so that the American people can assess what risk existed of those documents falling into the wrong hands. Does anyone seriously believe that a figure as influential as Biden has been since taking the Vice President’s office in 2009 somehow DOESN’T keep a visitors log for his home? I guarantee that when Trump’s home was raided for retaining classified documents, a visitors log was seized and analyzed. So what is Biden hiding? A log must exist, so the fact that he denies this means there must be something in it he doesn’t want Americans to see.
2023-01-17;https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-considered-but-rejected-role-in-biden-documents-search-11673991364;authoritarianism;Apparently the Justice Department assessed that, while Trump needed to be raided by the FBI for keeping classified documents in a way he is legally allowed to (as a classification origin), Biden’s illegal retention of classified documents in multiple locations did not require FBI involvement. Any politically conscious American capable of rational thought understands exactly why they came down on these two conclusions. The left-leaning FBI will always go easier on the Democrats than the Republicans, even when the Democrats commit a more serious offense. How is this anything other than federal law enforcement being used to persecute one party as a way to assist the other? Countries with national political police are those like China and Iran, where one party dominates and oppresses the populace. I dare any Democrat to explain how the FBI is in any way different from the secret police in China and Iran.

The left claims over and over that movements like LGBT and BLM are not political, that they’re simply the respecting of people of certain identity groups. So if that is indeed true, then why are they worried that a ban on political bias would prevent them from discussing such movements? The answer is that they know that their claims of these movements being “apolitical” are lies, and meant only to provide cover to sneak these eminently political movements into every sector of American society. The lie becomes plain for all to see when the right calls their bluff. As soon as a policy of political neutrality is imposed, suddenly LGBT and BLM are political movements being silenced. And of course, the left would jump to defend political neutrality if schools were teaching students that abortion is immoral, or that systemic oppression doesn’t exist. And yet the right is willing to take some of their key beliefs off the table for classrooms whereas the left refuses to give an inch. It goes to show just who is trying to indoctrinate children. Not a single American should oppose political neutrality in schools. So when one faction DOES oppose it, every American should immediately be skeptical.

Is there a single American in this entire country who thinks rape or murder should be punished less severely? Then why are Democrats doing exactly that? To Democrat mayor Bowser’s credit, she saw the moral repugnance of such a policy and attempted to thwart it. Her fellow Democrats, however, are forcing her hand. Can America really afford to endure a party which not only defies the overwhelming popular will, but does so on matters of public safety which will result in more dangerous streets?

Anyone on the left who defends Antifa owes us an explanation about how this isn’t terrorism. This particular Antifa cell is illegally squatting on government property to prevent the construction of a police training facility. Not only that, but to prevent their removal from the premises, they resort to shooting at and attempting to kill sworn agents of the state. How is Antifa anything other than a leftist domestic terrorist organization? The definition of terrorism is “the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.” Explain to me, leftists, how Antifa doesn’t fit this definition? No one is denying that there are certain right-wing domestic terrorist groups in existence. There are. But no one can rationally deny that the left has its own terrorists.

Recall that Hunter Biden was employed at that time by companies in foreign, in some cases hostile countries. Imagine if Donald Trump, Jr. had been working for a Chinese company and had been seen at Mar-A-Lago near Trump’s retained classified documents. Imagine the (completely deserved) uproar from the left. Yet there is nothing even close to that in this case. The Biden family casually endangers national security by their improper handling of classified documents and their ties to hostile foreign powers. The left is wiling to overlook this purely because of how pathologically they hate Trump, and chafe at the idea of vindicating him in the slightest. 
2023-01-18;https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0279273 ;indoctrination;A new study shows that a college education has correlated with women becoming more liberal since 1974, hinting strongly at the idea that universities indoctrinate their students into the left. With modest fluctuation throughout American history, roughly equal numbers of voters support the mainstream liberal party and the conservative political party (with a number of independents between them). Thus, the political spectrum in the US tends toward balance. So if post-secondary education was truly unbiased and merely taught critical thinking skills, then roughly equal numbers of students would move leftward, rightward, or toward the center. So the fact that a college education consistently moves students to the left shows that, in fact, post-secondary academic institutions ARE biased, specifically in favor of the left. The left loves to claim that universities do teach critical thinking, and that the left is so rational and righteous that the application of critical thinking inevitably moves students to the left. But this entire archive is inescapable proof that the left is, at the barest of minimums, as delusional and morally vacuous as the right, if not more so. So this claim that the left is just aligned with the objective truth of the universe is just laughable on its face. At this point, the data of colleges skewing left is ample enough that this conclusion cannot be denied.

How much clearer can it get that the highest law enforcement and national security entities in this country are biased in favor of the Democrats, to the point of deliberately overlooking lawbreaking? Literally the FBI will allow Democrats to keep classified documents illegally, but will punish the Republicans severely for daring to keep classified documents even when doing so is not illegal (as in Trump’s case). The idea that all Americans are equal under the law is a fraud. If you are a powerful Democrat, the law doesn’t apply to you. Everyone else is fair game, and those who dare to challenge the Democrats are face political persecution under this same biased law. How is this not the exact same legal privilege that Putin’s cronies get in Russia, or the Saudi royals get in Saudi Arabia, or Xi Jinping’s loyalists get in China? Every high-level Democrat needs to stand in front of a microphone, go on every news show in the nation, and explain how what they do is different from the legal immunity of these despots and their friends around the world in the most oppressed nations on the planet.

So Biden is willing to lie about the national security of our nation and its current and former highest-level officers, all to avoid admitting that he messed up and broke the law in retaining classified documents after leaving office in 2017. Again, can we afford to have such people in power? And how is Trump’s retention of classified documents worse than this?
2023-01-20;https://gbi.georgia.gov/press-releases/2023-01-20/gbi-investigates-officer-involved-shooting-following-multi-agency ;authoritarianism;The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has charged seven Antifa members with domestic terrorism charges in connection with the shooting of a state law enforcement officer. In fairness, these are not convictions... at least not yet. As such it would be unfair to call them domestic terrorists. But should they be convicted, will a prominent Democrat then FINALLY designate Antifa as the domestic terrorist organization that it plainly is, by the standard definition of “terrorism”? We shall see, but if Democrat behavior up to now is any indication, this is unlikely. When Democrats condemn domestic terrorism, they are perfectly fine with carving out exceptions for the domestic terrorists who reinforce their liberal agenda. Is this the kind of party that has any business near power?

This is classic Democrat behavior: cry when they finally have to suffer the consequences of their disastrous policies. They’re just fine with others suffering for their actions, but put their foot down as soon as they have to pay even the smallest share of the price. It also shows that the Democrats don’t believe in their own policies. They don’t really want to let any immigrant walk into the US, because as soon as they get what they ask for they ask Biden to make it stop. The Democrats stand for nothing, and don’t care how many (other) people suffer on account of their caprices.

Is this the rhetoric of someone who takes public safety concerns seriously? Clearly, she doesn’t care that cash is vital to street vendors’ businesses. She doesn’t feel like doing anything to allow them to continue to use cash to facilitate their business. This just so happens to align perfectly with Democrats’ pro-corporate policies: screw the small business owners, and let’s bend over backward to throw free money at the biggest, richest companies there are. I would love for the left to explain how this policy makes them the champion of the “little guy”.

If the “vaccines” are so safe, why does a majority of the American people think the CDC should be investigated over its role in pushing these drugs? It’s almost like Americans are waking up to the ample data that shows that these experimental drugs were dangerous and the government either knew or willfully didn’t check.

A study which wasn’t even testing any aspect of the COVID “vaccines” directly incidentally discovered that the mRNA molecules remain detectable in the blood 28 days after a dose is administered. That’s a heck of a lot longer than the 10 days that public health officials throw around. But there’s more here than public health “experts” being wrong. How could they be this wrong? How could they not know. If a study on Hepatitis C bumped stumbled on the 28-day window for detecting COVID shot mRNA in the blood, how is it that these public health bodies weren’t aware? How is it that there were no studies which INTENTIONALLY and DIRECTLY thought to determine how long COVID jab mRNA particles lingered in the blood? How was this accidental discovery the FIRST discovery of this fact? Was this missing from the data Pfizer and Moderna gave the FDA? Or did the FDA know and conceal it from the American people? Either these health officials and regulators are the stupidest, most incompetent people of all time, or this information was deliberately concealed or left undiscovered. How is it that we are supposed to trust “experts” who behave this way?

Even if we assume that these instances of mishandled documents was not malicious, how can we afford to have a leader who is so careless with information so sensitive? If these documents were just lying around Biden’s house, and we have no idea who visited the residence, how do we know that China or other enemies didn’t get their hands on the files? How many more classified documents are there that Biden removed from the White House in 2017, and who knows where they are? Even after Biden has proven beyond doubt that he was WAY more careless than Trump, Biden still hasn’t been raided by the FBI. How is this not a double-standard that favors the Democrats (like it always does)?

Anyone on the left who doesn’t condemn Antifa owes their fellow Americans an explanation as to how these actions somehow DON’T count as domestic terrorism. And how is it that not a single Democrat at the federal level has come out to condemn this? The Democrats say they are so opposed to domestic terrorism, so shouldn’t this be easy for them to condemn? This is where we are as a nation: the Democrats would rather stay silent and keep from condemning leftist terrorists than to admit that not everyone who sides with them is peaceful and law-abiding. Most of the highest level national Republican leaders have condemned the events of January 6, 2021, but the Democrats won’t condemn actions that are far more destructive to life and property that are committed by their aligned radicals, rioting for the arrest of their comrades who shot at agents of the state.

All the Democrats who say they are opposed to domestic terrorism owe every American an explanation for why one of their children was associating with a domestic terrorist group and assaulting law enforcement. The reason they won’t is that the Democrats have no issues with terrorists who support them. They also need to explain how the destruction and violence of Antifa is somehow not as bad as what the right-wing extremists do. There is no denying that there are right-wing extremists, many of whom hold morally reprehensible views. But the difference is that very few of them cross over into violence and lawbreaking. Meanwhile, Antifa members REGULARLY assault the police (and innocent civilians) with deadly weapons and set buildings on fire. How is this NOT fascist? Even if one were to concede that right-wing extremists are fascists, that would only make Antifa doubly fascist, since they OBJECTIVELY commit more crimes and violence. Where are all the right-wingers shooting and throwing explosives at police and setting their vehicles on fire? Where are they? IF they’re out there, there are way fewer of them than Antifa members doing the exact same thing.

The Democrats love to speak for Latinos and pursue radical policies in their name, that of open borders in this particular instance. But when Latinos actually speak for themselves, most of them reject Democrats’ failed and unfair immigration policies. Democrats can either hold their views on immigration regardless of what their constituency believes, or they can be faithful to the Latino community they claim to defend... but they can’t do both. It’s almost like the Democrats only see Latinos and other minority groups as props, and couldn’t be less interested in actually helping these groups. The Latino community, at least, is starting to wake up to this reality. 
2023-01-25;https://www.projectveritas.com/news/pfizer-executive-mutate-covid-via-directed-evolution-for-company-to-continue/ ;COVID;A Pfizer Director of Research and Development was caught admitting that Pfizer is experimenting with controlling the mutation of SARS-CoV-2 in order to follow it more closely than its competitors, and thus make larger profits. Is there a single person in this country with a moral center who thinks this is ethical? Over the course of the pandemic, the left lavished praise on Pfizer for supposedly ending the pandemic even when their mRNA COVID shot useless at stopping the spread. Now it turns out that Pfizer wants to control the virus that causes COVID in order to maximize profits. Pfizer obviously can’t supply the whole world with drugs. So, if Pfizer had its way and it directed the virus’s evolution so finely that no competitor could even come close to their level of efficacy, they would basically be condemning millions around the world to disease because no other drug makers could cover the gap between Pfizer’s industrial output and all the world’s possible COVID patients. Pfizer is essentially OK with worsening access to effective COVID drugs so that it can make more money. If the company is willing to contemplate this, then they are certainly willing to lie about the safety and efficacy of their drugs. Is that why Pfizer claimed a 100% effectiveness when their shot first came out, only for the real data to show that it didn’t stop the spread and the vaccinated still got COVID? Were they just inept or lying? And how can we trust public health officials who pushed Pfizer’s products on Americans at every turn, even using coercion. Are American pharmaceutical regulators so stupid and unfamiliar with the industry that they didn’t think Pfizer engaged in morally bankrupt practices like this. It’s also interesting how every Democrat said to take the jab, no questions asked, while the Republicans almost all RECOMMENDED the jab but insisted on freedom of choice, to which the Democrats responded with censorship. Either the COVID jab debacle is the result of an astounding number of coincidental screw-ups, or all the proponents of the “vaccines” knew what they were supporting and did so anyway.

Isn’t it interesting that when Republicans like DeSantis bus migrants out of state, they are condemned by every Democrat and media outlet, but when Democrats like Hobbs do the same thing, there is zero condemnation? Some leftist activists are consistent in their criticism, but the mainstream left gives their team a pass when doing the very thing they blasted Republicans for. This should be yet another data point showing that the Democrats don’t believe in anything, and will criticize Republicans for anything, even when they do the exact same thing.

In fairness, Pompeo’s statement by itself proves nothing. However, he made a very serious and unambiguous allegation against Schiff, the kind that cannot be taken lightly. And the Twitter Files reporting would suggest this to be so as well. Reporting using Twitter’s internal documents showed the Democrats making a claim about Russian disinformation on Twitter that Twitter itself flatly informed them wasn’t occurring. But because the Democrats wanted to make the case, they lied and then claimed the the classified sources they were party to proved it and that we just had to believe them. The Democrats rely heavily on the intelligence community to supposedly prove the validity of their political agenda. Leaking documents that reinforce them is very much in keeping with their overall practices.

At one point, this director attacked the journalist and destroyed the tablet the journalist was using to conduct the interview. If this guy didn’t do anything wrong then why did he assault a journalist and destroy the journalist’s property? If Pfizer really isn’t doing this, then he could just easily deny it and call the journalist’s claims absurd. It just shows that the greedy soulless ghouls in the pharmaceutical industry who profited off the world’s misery are getting found out, and they aren’t taking it too well at all. 
2023-01-26;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWvOlXzpGtY;authoritarianism;Antifa’s terrorism is so blatant that even Sanders-supporting Rogan has condemned the group for it. The violence and property destruction they wreak in service of their politics is enough by itself to make Antifa fit the definition of terrorists. But factor in the fact that Antifa members shot at a law enforcement officer, and the fact that Antifa cells nationwide then rioted in retaliation against law enforcement for neutralizing a threat to the public by killing the Antifa gunman who tried to kill them, and the group’s terrorist nature cannot be denied. Journalists and experts who witnessed and reviewed footage of Antifa’s recent riots in Atlanta concluded that they even operated in an organized fashion that suggested careful planning and rehearsal. And while Antifa is lighting cities on fire because law enforcement dared to kill one of them for trying to kill them, mainstream media is tying itself in knots to try to characterize the violent anarchist riots as “mostly peaceful”. Antifa is literally armed with firearms and shooting to kill at law enforcement and the media calls them “mostly peaceful, and yet they didn’t call the January 6 Rioters mostly peaceful. The left can burn down cities and engage in wanton attempted homicide and they’re “mostly peaceful” by the media’s reckoning, yet the January 6 Rioters march around the Capitol and it gets labeled as a violent attempted coup. How can anyone compare the coverage of these two events and reach any other conclusion than that the media is on the left’s side?

The footage shows exactly corroborates what was described to journalists by unnamed law enforcement sources months ago: the door opened onto Pelosi and his attacker conspicuously and bafflingly standing squarely in front of the door, and then the attacker begins accosting Pelosi with a hammer. The two are each maintaining a grip on the hammer, but it sure doesn’t look like they are engaged in a frantic struggle over it (as one would normally expect of an assault with a melee weapon). They practically pose for the cops before the attacker wrenches the hammer form Pelosi’s grip and begins beating him with it. It’s almost as though the two wanted the interaction to be caught on police body camera. Because if that wasn’t the case, why wasn’t he attacker beating Pelosi before the police showed up? And then when the police did show up, why did the attacker not wait for the police to leave before attacking Pelosi? Given the current evidence, literally no explanation besides that it was a staged attack makes sense. And yet the Democrats will deny this. But where is their countermanding evidence? Where is the evidence that suggests that this was an authentic attack? There is none. The Democrats are literally willing to stage attacks that result in serious injuries to their family members just to justify their fabricated narrative that the Republicans are inspiring violence against them. Do people not realize how phenomenally dangerous a party like this is? If the Democrats are willing to stage attacks on themselves so they can smear their opponents as violence-advocating terrorists, what lengths won’t they go to? This is not a party we can trust with any level of power.

And just who is it pushing us closer to this terrifying possibility? Oh, that’s right, Biden and the Democrats. They’re the one playing nuclear chicken with a cornered Russia. If Russia is willing to invite the ire of its people by drafting them, it’s willing to use nuclear weapons if the war goes badly enough for them. Both parties share in the blame of backing Russia into a corner over decades. But Biden is the proximate cause of the current conflict, and the direct cause of the nuclear escalation. He has literally given Ukraine intelligence, guided Ukraine on how to destroy Russia’s biggest military assets, and all the while openly bragged about doing so. And every warning Putin has issued about the perilous escalation, Biden has brushed aside. So who really brought us to this alarming precipice? Americans should know as clear as day EXACTLY who to thank.

Democrat will do anything to make their opponents look bad, and will wriggle out of taking any accountability for themselves. Biden and the Democrats want to make it look as though they have enacted racially just policies and made such huge strides in that regard when, in reality, nothing has changed since Trump. They have done absolutely nothing to help racial minorities, but they are working to keep a lid on leftist protesting to make it seem as though they have. How can anyone trust such deceitful people? They’re also apathetic and lazy. They could have ACTUALLY put measures in place to materially help racial minorities. But instead, they’d rather just manipulate the optics to create the perception they’ve done something when they haven’t. The Republicans do not have any explicitly race-based policies, so no one should be disappointed when they do not address racial issues. But the Democrats take the worse, manipulative approach of professing how concerned they are about racial justice and then doing nothing of substance in that regard. So who is really on the side of racial minorities, the side that treats them like everyone else, or the side that promises to help and then does everything to avoid actually helping?

In one particular case, activists shut down a major bridge in Tennessee. When a black trucker stuck on the bridge pleaded to be let through so he could make it to his job on time, the activists rebuked him. How is this helping racial justice? How is it racially just for mostly white, affluent leftist activists to jeopardize the livelihoods of working-class black Americans? That’s because BLM is not about helping black people. BLM is an instrument of the left to use black people as a pretext to advance radical social change which will ultimately harm the black people they claim to help. When the leftists disband the police and eliminate cash bail, black people will be the overwhelming majority of victims when violent crime inevitably goes up. When the leftists enact an educational regime that gives up on educating black people and instead just slaps an “A” on their transcripts and shoves them out the door—what Bush called “the soft bigotry of low expectations”—black people will only become less prepared for the job market. When leftists radically shift our nation’s energy and economic base away from petroleum and manufacturing, black working-class Americans will be the ones who can’t fuel their cars and who will be hit hardest by structural layoffs. Every policy the left has that supposedly helps black people only worsens their lives. So who are the real racists? 
2023-01-28;https://thepostmillennial.com/pfizer-responds-to-project-veritas-exposing-pfizer-exec-denies-mutating-covid-19-virus-for-new-vaccines;COVID;The undercover journalism exposing Pfizer’s unethical and dangerous “directed evolution” practices inflicted such a huge PR hit on Pfizer that they issued a response statement which, though it denied it engaged in such practices, did not address the employee outed in the reporting. It could very well be the case that this statement is true. But given Pfizer’s history of outright lies, such a possibility is highly doubtful. The head of Pfizer initially claimed that their drug was “100% effective” against COVID, and that it absolutely stopped the spread. It is very hard to believe that Pfizer’s testing data was so bad that they sincerely thought their COVID jab was 100% effective only to find out in real world application that it wasn’t. Using Occam’s Razor shows that the more likely explanation is that they knew and lied, and not that a multi-billion dollar company failed to discover this after months of massive trials. So this claim that the company is not doing directed evolution is probably also a lie, especially given the director’s reaction when he was confronted about his statements. 
2023-01-29;https://thepostmillennial.com/memphis-pd-dramatically-lowered-standards-before-hiring-officers-charged-in-tyre-nichols-death;law enforcement;Just a couple of years before the deadly beating of Nichols, the Memphis police department lowered its hiring standards, actions which were ultimately caused by leftist protesters creating a climate which vilified police and discouraged citizens from becoming police recruits. For years, leftist activists have been demonizing police and creating an atmosphere of hostility toward them. This, as any 9-year-old could reason out for themselves, will discourage citizens from becoming police. But because police are still necessary to maintain order despite the lower supply of recruits, the only way for cities to ensure an adequate police force is to lower standards. But when you lower standards, recruits are more likely to be reckless and violent, a conclusion a 9-year-old could also reach on their own. As leftists continue to bully police forces into accepting nearly anyone who expresses a hint of interest, to the point of overlooking warning signs, incidents like this will only increase. So if we really want to assign blame, it is the leftists who are the root cause of violent incidents of police brutality like that which Nichols suffered. I would really love to hear the left explain how they’re not making the police brutality issue worse. Explain to us all, leftist, how coercing police departments to hire violently reckless recruits helps reduce the number of black people (or any other people) who are beaten by police. They won’t have an explanation, because they can never admit that their real goal is to destabilize society. They are only too thrilled that demonizing police is a vicious cycle. This way they can accelerate the complete dismantling of policing, make our cities hellscapes of violence, and then impose their revolutionary project on society as a remedy when people are desperate. Marxism, which those at the heart of the “social justice” movement all subscribe to, prescribes exactly this. Read Herbert Marcuse for yourself if you have any doubts about the accuracy of this conclusion. How much longer are we going to let these foxes have free rein over the hen house? 
2023-01-30;https://thepostmillennial.com/us-air-force-general-predicts-war-with-china-by-2025;national security;After numerous presidential administrations in which China kept its distance from Taiwan, a US general is now predicting a Chinese invasion of the island in the next 2 years. There is only one president to blame for China’s rapid acceleration of its plans to take Taiwan: Biden. Trump took a hard, if not necessarily the best coordinated line on China. Obama at least tried to create a regional economic alliance against China (the failed TPP). But Biden has way too little, way too late to deter China. There is only one president responsible for going China and the US butting heads economically (under Trump) to China essentially not paying us any notice as it salivates over Taiwan. US presidents have held China at bay more than 70 years until Biden brought American deterrence crashing down. So how exactly is Biden defending democracy in the world when he projects so much weakness that the biggest bullies on the planet (Russia and China) decide that now is the time to make their dreams of geopolitical dominance come true? 
2023-01-30;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-2cnyUShJQ;COVID;Bill Gates is now admitting that the COVID mRNA “vaccines” don’t stop the spread, are not very effective, and lose potency very quickly. Where was this assessment a year ago? Considering how close Gates was to the vaccine production process as a funder and advocate, he must have known sooner than most the true effectiveness of the COVID jabs. Yet only now he’s admitting what we all know from millions of data points. It seems highly unlikely that Gates was just too stupid to reach the conclusion that ordinary pro-science COVID jab skeptics with open-source data did. In other words, it sure seems like Gates lied about the effectiveness of the COVID shots. Of course, he would just be one of many COVID jab-pushers who lied. But these are the same people who condescend anyone who disagrees with them no matter how firm the empirical footing, and believe they are entitled to credibility they have carelessly wasted.

When Trump attempted milder policies toward Huawei than this, he was lambasted as a racist (somehow, for deciding a certain multinational corporation was serving a hostile foreign nation-state) by everyone left of center. Now Biden is going further than Trump and yet neither the news media nor Democrats having any words of admonishment for him. It’s almost like the Democrats will make up reasons to be mad at Republicans even if they do the exact same thing. How does anyone trust such shameless hypocrites to be in charge? 
2023-02-01;https://www.axios.com/2023/02/01/college-board-ap-african-american-studies;identity;The College Board is insisting that no states had any influence on its decision, after merciless critique from Florida governor DeSantis, to revise its proposed AP African American Studies course that was filled with an incoherent mix of leftist ideologies with little to no connection to African-American history. If there was truly nothing objectionable—nothing to apologize for or revise out—in the AP African American Studies proposal, then why is the College Board revising it? And if this had nothing to do with the Florida governor’s office’s rigorous review and rejection of the course, the timing of this statement by the College Board—mere days after DeSantis blasted it publicly—sure is coincidental, isn’t it? This reasoning and suspicious timing make a plausible case that the College Board got caught red-handed trying to indoctrinate students and is now trying to walk this attempt back. The left loves to cry racism, but nothing about DeSantis’s criticism has anything to do with race. Rather, his criticism had to do solely with the fact that the course was being used as a Trojan horse to work in leftist dogma unrelated to African-Americans or their history. There is every reason to teach African-American history in our schools at a college level. But unrelated leftist ideologies like Queer Theory have nothing to do with African-American history. In fact, it is entirely possible to teach a nonpartisan accounting of African-American history. So why is the College Board and its leftist apologists so upset that DeSantis doesn’t want the course used as political indoctrination? If they aren’t trying to indoctrinate students, then none of the material should be affected by rejection on the grounds of political indoctrination. So the fact that they’re wailing bloody murder about DeSantis confirms that they got caught trying to indoctrinate students. If the left’s policies are so pure and unobjectionable, why do they consistently try to hide what they’re doing? How can anyone trust the left when this is how they behave?

It is, of course, highly probably that Waters’ daughter played a role on her election campaign, for which compensation would not be unreasonable. What’s unreasonable is the sum compared to the work. Even if the task was a full-time job (which there’s no way it was), $192,000 for 2 years (the term of service in the FEC filings), that would still work out to almost $50 per hour. For a 20-hour work week (again, likely an overestimation), the rate works out to almost $100 per hour. There is no way Waters’ daughter’s time is that valuable or skills that sought-after. This is plain and simple corruption. The Democrats love to use the political process as a source of personal enrichment. Most of them aren’t stupid enough to do so with the most meticulously recorded stream of funding in the entire government, though.

To give credit where credit is due, this was the responsible thing for Biden to do, in case there were documents that were missed during the initial discovery. However, he should have done this when the first instance of misplaced classified documents hit the news, or really months ago when they were first discovered. Biden was trying to hold out in the hopes that the Democrats’ ever-faithful media allies could run enough cover for him that this would blow over. But now that it’s clear that it won’t, Biden finally did the right thing he should have done months ago. Democrats claim to always do the right thing, but they only will too late and only when the public holds their feet to the fire.

A man pleaded guilty to making death threats against a Republican congresswoman. Yet all American hear about is the “domestic terrorism” of the right. How is the left not the real terrorist threat when supporters have gone to conservative Supreme Court justices’ houses intent on assassination, when leftist candidate supporters shoot at Republican congressmen, and when black-clad gangs shoot at law enforcement and set cities on fire? When we look at the tally, which side has committed more killings and attempted killings of the other side? It is the left, and by a wide margin at that. None of this is acceptable, but the left has no business criticizing the right while their own house is very much not in order.

All of these things correlate to Democrats occupying the White House. Can anyone seriously argue that China is scared of a US under Democrat rule?

How is it the Democrats can support such an unhinged and reckless leader? How is it they’re OK with Zelensky’s escalatory language which threatens to plunge the world into a nuclear holocaust? The answer is the Democrats, as a party, are just as unhinged. They have such an obsession with Russia that to them, nothing can go too far, even when backing a nuclear-armed state into a corner. How does anyone trust leaders as deranged as the Democrats?

Again, this isn’t to say that the proposed measure is wrong, just that the Democrats impose a double-standard that benefits them. How is this not racist by their own standards? Racism is just something that the Democrats use to character assassinate Republicans, and not something they actually care about. If they cared about racism, they would stay consistent to their standards. But they don’t, which shows the issue is just political theater. More importantly, How is it not racist of Democrats to use racial justice as a political cudgel against Republicans, only for them to not live up to the same standards they used to browbeat the Republicans? The answer is that this is exactly what makes Democrats the party of racists. Very few Republicans accuse Democrats of the racism that Democrats clearly embody, thereby not debasing the racial justice concerns that people sincerely hold.

How is this ethical behavior? How is this fitting behavior from a party which claims to uphold election integrity, and stand against foreign influence in our elections? This is worse than the collusion they accused Trump of engaging in, which turned out to be completely unfounded. Trump wasn’t even accused of paying the Russians, only in coordinating with them to get elected. Meanwhile, Democrat candidates paid a media entity that the government designated as working for the Chinese government. Explain to us, Democrats, how this ISN’T worse than the collusion you accused Trump of? 
2023-02-03;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GvVdl2TFoU;totalitarianism;Testing of the ChatGPT algorithm has shown it to bias against the political right, as well as against those belonging to the “white” and “Asian” racial groups. Numerous people have independently confirmed the same, biased results through testing the openly available ChatGPT AI algorithm. Instances of bias are clear. For instance, when the AI is asked to write a poem about the positive attributes of Donald Trump, it refuses stating that it does not deal in political subject matter. But when the AI is asked to the same for Joe Biden, it promptly generates a paean to the leader of the Democrats. Similarly, when asked to write an essay on the positive attributes of “whites” or “Asians”, ChatGpT refuses. But when asked to do so for “blacks” or “Latinos”, ChatGPT does not refuse the request but instead immediately fulfills it exactly. The issue is not that the AI has exceptions for political or racial subject matter… if it was enforced uniformly for all political factions or all races. What is galling is that these supposed exceptions exist, but are then discarded for the groups that the political left happens to favor. The AI will extol the Democrats and extol racial minorities (but not Asians, for some reason, even though the left insists that hate against Asians is rampant), but will not do so for Republicans or the racial majority. It is well-established by ample data that those in the tech field are overwhelmingly Democrat. And there is also increasing consensus on what a groundbreaking tool a mature natural language synthesis AI like ChatGPT would be for all of humanity. And as we near the maturation of such a tool, those who design and develop it are brazen enough to hard-code their political worldview into it and erase that of their opponents. The Democrats fit the definition of totalitarianism to the letter: totalitarianism is the insemination of every area of human life with the dominant party’s politics, and the eradication of all other political perspectives from society. How is a tool capable of answering any question or producing any content with natural language in which the left is promoted and the right effaced anything OTHER than totalitarianism?

Territorial sovereignty is the cornerstone of national security, and on this score Biden catastrophically failed. We still don’t know what is onboard the craft. For all we know, the surveillance device could be equipped with a dirty bomb capable of spreading radioactive fallout over hundreds of square miles, killing thousands. The US has also relied on early detection systems since the Cold War began to track incoming aircraft BEFORE they reach US airspace. As one would imagine, they are routinely upgraded to detect new enemy military technology which threatens to evade detection. And yet despite all that, the Biden administration failed to detect the threat before it was already hovering ominously over our nation and its people. Biden’s incompetence is so staggering that even Democrats are demanding answers. How can we trust a leader who is so ineffectual that he allows enemy aircraft to fly right over our country without any intervention or response? This is the weakest any president has ever been on national defense in the history of our nation, period. And Biden still hasn’t released any statement on the incident. Biden needs to go on TV, look into the camera, and tell every American why he failed to act. This is the most disgraceful failure of any American president to ever hold office. His incompetence is so staggering that his cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment, remove him from office, and install Harris as president. The incident illustrates just how weak China thinks the US. The fact that the surveillance balloon was deployed suggests China is getting ready for military action, likely the invasion of Taiwan. And the fact that we did nothing to stop them signals to them that now is the time for them to do just that. This adds more evidence to the case that China is going to invade Taiwan before Biden’s term is over. After all this, is there anyone left who thinks Biden can keep us safe? It would be interesting to hear from those who do.

In fairness to Biden, the article cites only an anonymous source, which is inherently unreliable. So it’s possible none of this is true. If it is true, though, then essentially Biden gambled with US national security all so that he and his administration didn’t look bad. This could also be why Biden didn’t order the balloon shot down before it entered US airspace: as even this would have forced Blinken not to go forward with his diplomatic mission. How is this even remotely acceptable? Biden risked thousands of lives just so that he didn’t give Republicans a win. Biden should be impeached and removed for that, because he put party over country. If that surveillance craft ended up having a weapon onboard that killed Americans, then Americans would have died all so that Biden didn’t give Republicans a PR win.

If she was a Democrat, every American would be hearing about it from mainstream media, Democrats, and leftist activists. And why exactly was she killed? Was it a personal grudge, or an act of political violence? There isn’t yet enough evidence to say, but the fact that the FBI is involved suggests that this is not the result of personal squabble.

Who knows how much intelligence the balloon was able to collect for the Chinese military before this long overdue response was finally taken. Biden makes the point that he didn’t want debris to potentially injure Americans, which is certainly a reasonable concern. But the balloon flew over nearly uninhabited regions of the US landmass, so why didn’t he order it downed at that point? Why didn’t Biden work with the Canadian government to down it within a sparsely populated region of Canada? For that matter, how is it that Canada didn’t do anything to this Chinese surveillance device, either? As a US ally, they should regard China to be just as hostile to themselves as we regard China to ourselves. It is very interesting that longstanding, commonsense military doctrine regarding territorial sovereignty of airspace was followed by neither Canada nor the US.

The process involved the US, Germany, and France, among other nations. But when the US stated its position in favor of aggression against Russia, this is when Ukraine took up its current “no surrender” position against Russia, in which Ukraine will accept nothing less than Russian expulsion from all Ukrainian territory before the 2014 invasion of Crimea. This is not a coincidence, especially considering how much intelligence the US has shared with Ukraine. It is a near-certainty that the US held secret talks with the Zelensky government promising to give Ukraine everything it wanted to fight Russia so long as they didn’t capitulate. We all know why Democrat Biden did this: the Democrats are obsessed with getting revenge on Putin for Clinton losing in 2016, despite the fact that there is no evidence Russia meaningfully swayed the election (though Russian nationals certainly did disseminate token quantities of disinformation).

The thinking behind this statement, it would appear, is to demonstrate that Biden’s allowing a Chinese spy balloon to roam freely over the US is not his fault because previous presidents failed to detect airspace incursions as well. But in admitting this “domain awareness gap”, the general has given our enemies a playbook they can use to bypass our defenses. These generals are so loyal to Biden politically (rather than solely legally) that they are willing to reveal US defense vulnerabilities just to keep Biden from looking bad. When our enemies attack us and kill thousands of Americans under Biden, then we’ll see just how much these generals’ loose lips helped Biden’s image.

The study cites lack of access to medical grade masks, improper wearing of masks, and lack of hygiene (e.g. touching the mask with unwashed hands) as reasons why the effectiveness of masks was negligible. Public health officials versed in the real science pointed to all of these cited factors as reasons why masks wouldn’t be effective, yet the CDC proceeded to mandate masks anyway. The CDC should have invested its time and energy into techniques that actually worked to stop COVID rather than those which a basic grasp of epidemiology suggested wouldn’t be effective (and which has now been proven so).

And how is this the behavior of a so-called “sanctuary city”? Didn’t these same Democrats profess all through the Trump administration that they welcome immigrants with open arms? How is busing them out of the country welcoming? Yet again, the Democrats prove they stand for nothing. They don’t actually believe in helping immigrants.

It is one thing for Biden to take this position, an unsurprising one considering how much China pays his son Hunter. But it’s another thing for the American media to heap praise on him. Biden’s decision could be described as “bold”, “gutsy”, “striking”, etc. but not “courageous”. “Courage” has a noble, inspiring connotation which Biden is totally undeserving of. The Republicans have accused the Democrats of weakness against America’s enemies, which they have always balked at.

Hersh, the journalist behind the report, has broken some of the most consequential stories in living memory. He has won Pulitzer Prizes, and has been widely regarded as a reporter of the highest integrity. He doesn’t take sides, but follows the facts. The circumstantial evidence long pointed to the outcome he reported. Why would Germany destroy its own pipeline, especially with winter approaching and a dire need for heating fuel? And why would Russia destroy its own pipeline, when it was sorely in need of trade as the world cut economic ties to it? The only party which would be served by destroying the pipeline would be an anti-Russian hardliner. No party has been more doggedly anti-Russian than the Biden administration. Now we have the proof. This act is staggeringly brazen. To destroy a fuel delivery system owned by another sovereign nation is a serious international crime.

But now that a government-run institution, paid for with American tax dollars, is censoring the political right, the Democrats have no answer or excuse. The Democrats didn’t stay consistent with their beliefs and their legal reasoning—they could have said “we disagree with the message, but this is illegal under the First Amendment”.

A 9-year-old can tell you that because criminals are deterred by the police, if the number of police go down, the incidence of crime will go up. This is logic that escapes the “Defund the Police” activists. These activists are also usually opposed to guns. If criminals were smart, they would target leftist victims because such victims are less likely to put up a fight. But for the most part, the rich white activists who call for these radical policies don’t suffer the consequences of their actions. Sadly, others, mostly poor and racial minority victims, pay the price for the warped, extreme leftist views. For once, the consequences visited the people most deserving of those consequences.

The inclusion of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” (which is commonly referred to as the “Black National Anthem”) in direct juxtaposition to the National Anthem is intentionally provocative and also, in ways that are likely lost on the left, extremely racist. The National Anthem is something that every American of every background is entitled to, something they are able to take pride in. The National Anthem belongs to all Americans. The idea that this most patriotic of songs must be supplemented with another anthem is offensive, and racist in 2 specific ways. One, it is racist against everyone who isn’t African-American because it implies that they deserve their own special recognition to which no one else is entitled. But when viewed from another angle, it is racist AGAINST black people. It is implying that they would be excluded without its inclusion, that they are excluded from the National Anthem. The left is basically saying that African-American aren’t Americans and aren’t welcome here. The National Anthem has been sung at sporting events for decades, to which black athletes and fans stood proudly (as they should). The left are the only ones telling African-Americans they don’t belong here. So who is REALLY striving to achieve racial unity?

What he and other former intelligence officials said was that it COULD be fake, that it could be planted by a foreign adversary as a disinformation operation. But he didn’t say this was definitely so, or even that there were even any facts one way or the other. But the media ran with this and borrowed his credibility to assert that the laptop was definitely fake. We all know now that it was bona fide. The press literally lied to help the Democrats win an election. Is there any doubt left that the media works for the Democrats?

Isn’t it in everyone’s best interest to know the truth? Why does the left think the truth is a threat to trans people (or anyone, for that matter)? So what are these leftists afraid they’ll find in the scientific evidence? If transgender transitions are so beneficial to trans people, shouldn’t the evidence show that clearly? This is how you know the trans activists don’t actually care about trans people. They’d rather conceal evidence that could save a trans person’s life (to use the same emotional blackmail they use on everyone else) than admit they’re wrong on any point.

The only intervention more “major” than the current one would be to send American troops to the frontlines.

Now, the DoJ announced that it would not be charging Gaetz. Where are the apologies from the media? Where are the update, corrections, or retractions?

If the left is correct, shouldn’t nonwhite person who can “pass” for white do so, and any white who can pass for nonwhite strictly refrain from doing so?

The Democrats talk so much about how they love the environment. So why aren’t they willing to do anything to clean up a toxic spill poisoning the water for miles? The Democrats loved to accuse Trump of being vindictive and not helping citizens of states and cities that did not vote for him. How is Biden’s behavior any different? 
2023-02-17;https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna71027;COVID;A new study shows that natural immunity was just as effective as the mRNA COVID jab at reducing the severity of COVID infections, including those of all known variants up until late last year. The vaccine apologists assured us all that the “vaccine” was “effective”, which they defined as preventing infection, preventing transmission, and preventing severe illness and death from COVID. By that definition, the COVID mRNA immune therapy is a failure. On the first measure of effectiveness, the jab did not prevent infection. In fact, some data shows a higher rate of COVID infection among the vaccinated than the unvaccinated. On the second measure, it did not prevent transmission. This is inescapably clear to all even anecdotally at this point, to say nothing of the mounds of evidence. And now on the third measure, it is no better than natural immunity. So if the jab doesn’t keep you from catching COVID and passing it on, and it’s no better than natural immunity at preventing severe illness and death, what point is there to get the jab? As of months ago, 75% of Americans have had COVID despite the fact that 2/3 of Americans were vaccinated. Why should someone take the jab when they have a high likelihood of catching COVID anyway, and when they will have comparable immunity after that infection? Anyone who knew in 2020 what is now undeniable would not have taken the jab. Once you catch COVID, there is no benefit to the jab. So how is it that this data was not available to the public from the beginning? Was it that the manufacturers’ studies were fabricated or fatally compromised and the FDA just took them at their words? Or was the data clear on the jab’s ineffectiveness and the FDA approved it anyway? And if the Justice Department doesn’t investigate the pharma giants to determine if they misled regulators, then that is a pretty good sign that the government was in on the fraud. The next few years of pharma investigations (or lack thereof!) will be interesting indeed.

He doesn’t think it’s hypocritical at all that he expects Russia to be fine with the US giving Ukraine weapons, but that China shouldn’t dare give Russia weapons. How are these two things not the same? In each case, a superpower is investing in a proxy war by providing weapons to their favored belligerent. More importantly, though, is that the Democrats are willing to provide weapons to this monomaniacal extremist in Ukraine and don’t seem at all alarmed by how cavalierly he saber-rattles nuclear-armed hostile powers. The Democrats truly do not care that they are giving powerful weaponry to a madman who is actively trying to provoke China and escalate an already dangerous conflict. Zelensky is playing a game of nuclear chicken, and the Democrats don’t see anything concerning about backing this person. Who do the Democrats think Zelensky thinks is going to back his nuclear saber-rattling? And the Democrats are risking open war between superpowers for the first time in world history, all over an insignificant European nation that is infested with Nazis, and one of the most corrupt countries in the world. Oh, wait, I know why: the Democrats will do anything to get back at Russia for supposedly electing Trump (even though the Trump-Russia collusion was proven to be completely unsupported by the facts), and the Democrats and their know-nothing family members just happen to get fat checks from corrupt Ukrainian oligarchs. Is that really a risk Americans are wiling to tolerate?

How is this anything but complete disrespect for the nation he was sworn to serve, and an act of pure selfishness and partisanship, not to mention reckless provocation in one of the tensest nuclear standoffs the world has ever seen?

The journalist noted that he heard no sirens for 5 days, but then did when Biden reached the city. What’s more likely, that Ukrainian authorities seriously and sincerely believed a Russian attack was imminent at that exact moment, or that Biden asked them to turn it on so he would look brave for traveling to a “warzone”? This just shows that the Democrats are both liars and cowards. It’s also manipulative, since it is meant to tug at Americans’ heartstrings until they endorse more funding to Ukraine. Literally, Biden is lying to the world (with Americans in mind) to trick them into funding the country that pays his corrupt drug addict son. Explain, Democrats, how this is integrity? Explain how this is better than Trump?

Russia is signaling that it is ready and willing to use nuclear weapons against the West, and Biden and the Democrats are not at all concerned about this. In fact, they only double down on backing Russia into a corner, where it will have no choice but to make frightening decisions out of desperation, decisions which could end all life on this planet. How is the escalation Biden is pushing the actions of a responsible president? Remember when the Democrats swore Trump would start a nuclear war? They owe us all an explanation on how exactly what they’re doing isn’t EXACTLY what they accused Trump of (only for Trump to never do so).

While Trump was helping Americans suffering from a manmade environmental disaster the week of Presidents Day, Biden was in the corrupt foreign country that pays his son, promising said country more money. I thought the Democrats were serious about saving the environment. So why aren’t they doing everything to clean up the spill? Even assuming Biden’s visit to Ukraine was pure in motive and supported by Americans, he could have easily postponed his trip to manage a domestic disaster. The Ukraine-Russia conflict is ongoing and showing no sign of resolution anytime soon. But instead Biden left the people of East Palestine to their own devices and heaped money on his best friend, Zelensky, a tyrant who outlawed opposing political parties and tolerates the existence of Nazis in his armed forces. 
2023-02-27;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhUwWsWVUwE;COVID;The media and public health officials are starting to concede that an anomalously high number of young people are suffering heart attacks, and their excuses to avoid admitting the mRNA immune therapy jab is to blame are wearing thin. The news and the public health establishment are finally acknowledging that young Americans are seeing a concerning and unusual spike in heart attacks since the COVID pandemic. However, their working explanation is that COVID is causing this, and that particularly unvaccinated young Americans are driving the rise in heart attacks. But this is not consistent with the data. First, why isn’t there a huge rise in heart attacks across all age groups if COVID infections are to blame? In fact, shouldn’t more severe cases, in which viral particles persist longer in the body, be associated with the highest rise in cardiac events? And which group has the lowest rate of serious cases? Children and young adults. So if anything, we should see elderly Americans (and those with other comorbidities) having the highest spike in cardiac events and children having the lowest. Second, it is the vaccinated who should have the highest rate of heart attacks, not the unvaccinated. This is because by this point, nearly every American has had COVID. By mid-2022, 75% of Americans had had COVID. Even if every single unvaccinated American caught COVID, that would mean that nearly half of vaccinated Americans would have caught COVID. By now that 75% figure is undoubtedly higher (indeed, it can only go up). So at this point it is safe to say that the majority of vaccinated Americans have contracted COVID. Studies show that the spike protein is cytotoxic. It inflames tissue. The mRNA immune therapy shot makes the body manufacture this very spike protein. Thus, the unvaccinated who contract COVID are exposed to the toxic spike protein of the virus. On the other hand, the vaccinated who contract COVID have already been exposed to the toxic spike protein from their body’s processing of the mRNA, and then they are exposed to yet more during the actual infection. So who is more likely to see a rise in cardiac events, the unvaccinated with exposed to an infection’s worth of spike proteins, or the vaccinated who were exposed to twice as many spike proteins? Third, and finally, we know the “vaccines” are associated with myocarditis. Studies show that males under 40 years of age are MORE likely to get myocarditis from the jab than from COVID. How does it make sense, in light of this fact, to say that NOT being vaccinated is the cause of the increased rate of heart attacks in adults under 40? Every data point and exercise of rational thought points to the mRNA COVID shots driving this. And yet the media and public health establishments will tie themselves into knots and make up some contrived excuse to blame anything BUT the “vaccines”. Explain how this is “following the science”.

If Trump (or any Republican) had a balloon company, got investments from China, and then didn’t shoot down Chinese balloons, he would immediately be accused of treason and face impeachment... and that wouldn’t necessarily be an unfair characterization. Yet when Democrats are in the exact same position, they face barely a whiff of criticism.

Crime, including violent crime, spiked during the pandemic, with Democrat-ruled states and cities leading the way. This trend is not coincidental with the “justice system reform” policies pursued in these jurisdictions. A 9-year-old could tell you that where one eliminates cash bail and declines to prosecute muggings, violence will go up on the whole. The demonization of the police also certainly contributed to the low homicide clearance rate. Police departments in highly populated urban areas around the country are all short of police. Again, a 9-year-old could tell you that the fewer police you have, the fewer murders will get solved. Yet the Democrats deny that these trends, which they have undeniably driven, are to blame. How much longer are people going to let Democrats turn their communities into crime-ridden hell-holes?

It seems extremely unlikely that the FBI did not reach this assessment BEFORE Biden became president. If anything, the investigative and intelligence trails have only steadily gone cold since 2019 when the pandemic began (in China, before its global spread). So if the FBI reached that conclusion now, it probably had already done so 3 years ago, when this assessment could have vindicated Trump who was accused of racism for making the very same assertion (that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology). So why didn’t the FBI say so as soon as it felt sure? To avoid vindicating Trump. The national security establishment is literally willing to go to any length to make the Republicans look bad and the Democrats look good. How is it we are supposed to trust the national security state to keep the nation secure when they put politics ahead of their duty? I dare anyone to make the delusional claim that the FBI is politically unbiased. The proof is undeniable that the FBI acts as an enforcement arm of the Democratic Party.

Taiwan has no reason to inflate the threat against China, as doing so could cause escalation that leads to real conflict when none would otherwise emerge. Taiwan also has no reason to play to US politics. They need US support regardless of who is in power, and in fact benefit more from US political unity than division. So the fact that they are warning of a near-imminent threat of Chinese invasion means that things are dire. And they are dire not because of anything Taiwan has or hasn’t done, but because the Biden administration has shown profound weakness. It is not coincidental that this took place after Biden allowed Chinese surveillance craft to transit over nearly the entire width of the continental US. This is yet more proof (if more is even necessary) that Biden is weak on China. Biden is well on his way to having the historical legacy of the president who let Taiwan, the last vestige of a free China, fall to communist tyranny.

How does it make any sense for those who are not US citizens to determine who holds US political office? The law is very clear about this loophole. In fact, it appears written to expressly allow it. So how is it that this legislation was known for 6 years and nothing was done to close it? Wouldn’t any reasonable person view this as an oversight which needs addressing? So what is more likely, that Washington elected officials are all so stupid that they didn’t catch this language at the time (or any time since), or that this is completely intentional? It sure looks like the Democrats (Washington is wholly under the thumb of Democrats) want non-citizens to vote, but aren’t willing to deal plainly with their constituents.

How is setting fire to vehicles and attacking police officers, for the purpose of securing the political outcome of canceling the construction of a police training facility, NOT terrorism by the very definition of the word? And I challenge the left to find any right-wing groups that commit as destructive—to life and property—acts of terrorism as Antifa. They won’t find any. That’s not to say there aren’t dangerous right-wing groups. There certainly are. But they are currently nowhere near as dangerous as Antifa has already proven itself to be. The group’s actions are all the more perplexing (really, suspect) given that the “fascist” to whom they responded, Trump, is out of power.

Especially if he was a regular rioter who ran the risk of being charged (which he strangely wasn’t despite how much he shows up in riot footage), he would have no reason to lie to the government as it would only fuel their case against him.

There is literally nothing more fascist and authoritarian than to claim that those revealing unedited footage are the REAL fascists and deceivers. Tyrants throughout history have used this very tactic to crush dissent. Now the Democrats are doing the same. How is unedited footage anything other than what ACTUALLY happened? Does the left not use unedited footage to justify their protests for “racial justice”? So what are they saying, that unedited footage can be taken out of context? So if that is true, then how could that not be applied to THEIR preferred footage? This is why the left has been careful not to take the rhetoric in this direction: it can be applied right back to them and unravel all their own political objectives. This is the essence of authoritarian propaganda and brainwashing: declaring what footage must be believed and what must be rejected as fake. There is only one party deploying this Orwellian tactic.

This makes sense, since the Democrats have no more steadfast allies than tech companies (except maybe the media). The political behavior of tech employees prove this, as 90% of the employees of every major tech company who donate to politicians donate to Democrats. So what’s more likely, that Democrats have suddenly been possessed with a fervor to regulate Big Tech and are just coincidentally starting with Twitter, or that Democrats (Biden currently controlling the FTC) are going after Musk for revealing their censorship tactics?

2023-03-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1633154582569254912;hypocrisy;Leftists love to claim that no major left-leaning politicians are pushing “equity”, nor that there is any difference between “equity” and equality, and yet any cursory look at what these politicians say to the public shows that this is a lie. The idea of “equity” is all over what Democrats say. This is classic left: first they deny that they are pursuing some harmful policy, and then when they can’t deny it anymore they claim that their pursuit of the policy is irrelevant while simultaneously gaslighting Americans that they never denied the existence of the policy. They did this same thing with Critical Race Theory (CRT): first the left claimed that it wasn’t in K-12 schools, and then when opponents found CRT in schools, the left claimed they never denied it was in schools but dismissed concerns saying that CRT is just another way of saying they teach the history of American chattel slavery. So whenever the left denies something, know there is a good chance they’re doing it, and will admit this in a few months’ time when evidence irrefutably disproves their claims. 
2023-03-08;https://thepostmillennial.com/breaking-former-cdc-head-tells-mtg-gain-of-function-research-likely-cause-of-covid;COVID;A former head of the CDC stated before Congress under oath that SARS-CoV-2 bore striking hallmarks of a genetically engineered virus, specifically one that is the product of gain-of-function research. It’s interesting to consider this statement alongside Fauci’s vehement denial before Congress (upon questioning by fellow physician Rand Paul) that the NIH (of which Fauci was the head) funded gain-of-function viral research during a government moratorium. It’s even more interesting to consider those two points alongside the fact that the Wuhan Institute of Virology (the most likely source of SARS-CoV-2 given evidence as of the date of this hearing) was a recipient of US government research funding by way of the EcoHealth Alliance Organization. This circumstantial evidence of notable coincidental facts all seem to point in the same direction. It will be interesting to see what light the declassified COVID origins intelligence, which both houses of Congress unanimously approved, shed on these facts.

They slung every bit of mud they could at the two journalists short of calling them the “enemy of the people” as Trump did. Granted, it is certainly hypocritical of Republicans to put those journalists on a pedestal who report unflattering truths about the Democrats. However, it was the Democrats who said that only fascists deny the credibility of journalists and try to out their sources, and then proceeded to do exactly that when the journalists revealed the authoritarianism of the Democrats. How is it anything but authoritarian for a politician to demand a journalist reveal the source that reported on the politician’s unethical conduct so that the politician is able to politically persecute the source? Every Democrat who demanded Taibbi’s and Shellenberger’s sources should be made to explain how they aren’t the real authoritarians?

How does this make any sense to a rational person? What purpose could this bill possibly serve besides intentionally destabilizing American society? There are criminal justice reform policies which reasonable people can take different views on. But this proposal is not such a policy: the only people who would support it are those who have their own agenda in mind, and not the safety of the public they swore to serve.

First, this is yet more proof that the left are every bit the terrorists they claim the right is, and then some—let’s not forget that the most destructive attacks on politicians in the last decade have been by the left (e.g. the leftist shooting at congressional Republicans practicing softball). Second, this shows how radical left politics ultimately goes when followed to its logical conclusion. The left claims how they respect “the process” of government, yet they are the first to riot in the streets and threaten death against their own elected leaders when they don’t get heir way.

The idea that the left has no authoritarian extreme is completely illogical and delusional, and the fact that scientists who should know better are stating exactly this is extremely revealing. While, in this case, it is only one researcher (as credible as his professional background may be) who is claiming that psychology circles tend to deny left-wing authoritarianism, the rarity of studies on left-wing authoritarianism corroborates his claim. So why would any psychologists openly state that left authoritarianism is nonexistent? It’s because they are that desperate to distract from the very left-wing authoritarianism they either support, condone, or enable. It would be one thing for these leftist scientists to say “left-wing authoritarianism exists, but it is not present in America right now”. While untrue, it is not such an outrageously false statement as saying “left-wing authoritarianism is impossible and has never occurred in human history”. What is more likely, that most psychologists are astoundingly stupid (and thus don’t know that left authoritarianism exists), or that they are leftists (and thus DENY that left authoritarianism exists)? Numerous studies and polls show that academia is dominated so thoroughly by leftists that there are almost no one right of center to be found there. So how would this not extend to the psychologists in that very same academic realm? This should be the last bit of proof anyone needs to see to know that science has been corrupted by left ideologues. They are willing to lie about that which they study to promote their cause. It is a sad day indeed when one cannot trust scientists. The left, and no one else, has brought us to that day.

How are Americans supposed to believe his assurances that everything is fine, especially from the president who has seen the worst inflation in 40 years? A 9-year-old could deduce that American banks are in trouble despite anything Biden says, yet the left doesn’t want to believe that their glorious leader could ever make such a mistake. Biden has done more damage to the American economy than any president since the Great Depression.

How is this possible? Because California is one of the most left-wing states in America (and the biggest of those left-wing states). If Democrats care so much about social issues, how is it that they rank the worst on every social issue? Areas the Democrats control have the most homeless people, the highest crime rates, the most racially segregated cities, and many more appalling distinctions. Anyone who claims to care about social issues, about helping people, who votes Democrats is either an idiot or a liar.

These rankings are not just for racial hate crimes, but assessed against all hate crimes, including sex-based hate crimes, sexuality-based hate crimes, and religious-based hate crimes. Hate should not be tolerated, but the left is eager to pretend that it only affects non-white races (and non-racial categories). This is the lie they tell to advance an agenda that is not about racial justice and harmony but racial retribution and strife.

How can Biden pretend that halting trading is not an alarming sign for US banking? Is he that stupid, or does he think Americans are that stupid? Either way, is that a quality that anyone thinks a president should have? Does anyone seriously think the Biden administration has a handle on this looming economic crisis?

How does anyone trust Biden to handle the American economy in the slightest at this point? Not only that, but why does any American tolerate his lies? He claimed to solve inflation when he didn’t. How stupid do Democrats think Americans are that they tell Americans that inflation subsided to normal levels when it didn’t? Did they think Americans wouldn’t notice their expenses going up month after month into 2023? What case could anyone possibly make to support this administration? How is this better than any of Trump’s economic policies? 
2023-03-14;https://thepostmillennial.com/drew-barrymore-kneels-before-trans-identified-tiktoker-dylan-mulvaney-in-gushing-display-of-deference;identity;Leftists are so fanatical that they literally worship those with minority identities solely for their minority identity. What does Mulvaney contribute to society at all other than a trans identity? All of Mulvaney’s content fixates on this element and no other. The only grounds on which to worship Mulvaney is an adoration of trans people. And the left has the audacity to argue that the right are the fanatics. Some of them undoubtedly are: Trump has a die-hard following. But it doesn’t even compare to the way the left worships anyone they designate as “oppressed”. By definition, anyone who is diagnosed with gender dysphoria has a mental illness, so a worship of these people for their trans identity is a worship of mental illness. Democrats identify themselves as having mental illness at significantly higher rates than Republicans or independents. The Democrats are a cult of mental instability of one kind or another. How does worshiping someone with a serious mental health issue help them treat that issue? How does that do anything but worsen it? This is why the Democrats are so hypocritical, manipulative, and abusive: they would rather use trans people as a political prop and exacerbate their suffering than help them. One can argue that the right aren’t compassionate toward trans people, but by their actions the Democrats have proven beyond doubt that they certainly aren’t compassionate.

Newsom’s wine companies are held by SVB, meaning he he stood to lose significant sums if the bank went belly up. We know that the bank mostly served the tech industry. We also know that the employees and leadership of tech companies skew overwhelmingly in favor of Democrats.

2023-03-16;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/16/russia-vows-to-respond-proportionately-to-us-provocations;geopolitics;The Biden administration continues to escalate tensions with Russia by butting into a war that most Americans don’t want the nation involved in. Biden sent a US surveillance drone to snoop around the warzone. In itself, this is an understandable move. But in making this move, Biden had to acknowledge that there was a chance it would be downed. And yet when a Russian plane took down the drone, which was spying on Russia as it was fighting in Ukraine, Biden acted like that was a completely outrageous thing to do. Of course Russia shot down a drone collecting intelligence that would end up in Ukraine’s hands. If Biden didn’t want that to happen, he shouldn’t have done it. Russia is not flying its aircraft provocatively close to America’s areas of control, because Russia understands that doing so risks that they will be shot down. Why doesn’t Biden understand that the same applies in reverse? By flying American hardware near Russia in a war—hardware which, by its intended purpose, works directly against Russia’s war effort—America should know that Russia will view it as a form of American hostility. In war, hostility is met with hostility. America flying an unmanned drone to help Russia’s enemy is not much different from flying a manned one. Had Russia shot down a manned US aircraft, the two nations would then be at war. It sure seems like Biden is playing with fire and does not begin to understand how much he is escalating toward open war with Russia. It is one thing for the Biden admin to give money and weapons to Ukraine. It is quite another to have Americans fly American craft in the Ukraine theater. This action was one technical/logistical distinction away from starting a war with nuclear players. Explain, Biden, how daring Russia to start a war with the US, all to ensure your corrupt failure of a son can keep getting a paycheck (from Burisma and others) for sitting on his ass, makes Americans safer?

If hate against minorities was so rampant, why did one have to make stage a hoax attack to catch one in the act?

Again, if they were truly the victims, they would not have to fabricate instances of victimization.

On top of that, it looks really bad that the US has abdicated its peace mediator role to China. China is increasingly looking like the responsible geopolitical player, winning more and more nations to its side. Biden is literally letting the world order transfer from one which the US guides to one which China dominates. How much freedom will there be in the world when China governs international institutions? When China controls the sea lanes?

If the laptop were fake, Hunter Biden should be suing the media instead for slandering him. But if the laptop were fake and the reporting was slander, he would have no standing to sue the repair shop. So by suing the repair shop, Biden is trying to extract damages for the dissemination of material on his computer. Where is the mainstream media in reporting this fact? Nowhere to be found. The media is so subservient to the Democrats that they will never admit they were wrong to suppress and ignore this story, no matter how many facts corroborating its authenticity emerge. The media does not see as its job the informing the public, but instead the dissemination and propagandization of the Democrats’ chosen narrative. And they have the audacity to bemoan the record low trust in them.

Neither the FDIC nor the US Treasury can afford to cover all the accounts of every medium-sized bank that asks. If they did, taxes would soar. But the Democrats love throwing money at their friends, so what are the odds that Biden will go for it? And even if he doesn’t, the markets will wobble if he says no. In this way, the precedent he set mere days ago is already haunting him. How is this a better handling of the economy than Trump, as Biden vowed?

This is not behavior that is consistent with the notion that SVB and Signature Bank failing was just an isolated phenomenon that was unique to their specific circumstances. Think about it: if a couple of banks collapse because they mismanaged their affairs, why would the global banking industry jump to take coordinated action? Banks don’t like to turn any attention away from making money, so the fact that so many around the world did is cause for concern. And yet Biden is telling everyone that everything is fine. Does he really expect the world to buy that?

So which side is REALLY the one that respects peace and justice, and the fabric of our society? The Democrats love to accuse the Republicans of condoning political violence, yet the Republicans are urging the political right not to even protest if a prosecutor abuses his office to bring politically motivated charges against Trump. Meanwhile, the Democrats regularly encourage protests which they know will devolve into looting, property damage, and violence. There is only one side that has a shred of respect for law and order, and it’s not the Democrats.

Critics will say that China is biased toward Russia, and maybe this is so in a larger geopolitical sense. But in terms of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, urging peace is not in Russia’s favor. Russia’s goal is still to annex all of Ukraine, so by China calling for peace talks, they are asking Russia to give up on this goal. What does it say that China is becoming the peace broker the world turns to, a role that America used to hold above all others? It shows how deranged US foreign policy has become under Biden and the Democrats. Biden is willing to risk nuclear war with Russia all to defend a nation that has no strategic value to the US, but which pays his worthless son for supposed expertise (petroleum production) which he most certainly does not have. Biden is literally putting the enrichment of his family over the US having respect in the world. He’s giving away America’s role as the rational global peacekeeper all so his son can make a buck. How is ANYTHING Trump did worse than this?

Biden would not care if Ukrainians were tired of fighting and wanted to settle with Russia. He would insist they keep hurling their bodies at the Russian war machine, all so Biden and his family can keep getting payments from corruption Ukrainian oligarchs. The Biden administration is twisting Ukraine’s arm into fighting by offering them an array of weapons and heaps of cash. To the Democrats more broadly, Ukraine is just a pawn in the chess game against Russia, which they will never forgive for supposedly being the deciding factor in Trump’s election (and not their weak, unlikable candidates).

How stupid are leftists that they get exactly the rational consequences of their policies—which any 9-year-old could deduce—and then complain about it? How is it idiots like this receive any votes in elections? How do these people deserve even an ounce of the public trust if they don’t understand basic cause and effect relationships like “less money for cops equals more crime”? Yet the left will never admit they were wrong, or that they’re too cowardly to live with the consequences of their policies. The left’s main modus operandi is to enact radical policies that other people have to suffer under, and then complain when they have to share in the burden.

Sometimes exchanges get heated, but ultimately a journalist is supposed to put hard questions to the press secretary for the most powerful person in the world. And yet when a journalist dared to criticize the White House press secretary, other journalists sided with the press secretary to chastise him.

Anyone who has taken public transit knows that a great many transit workers (majorities in some cities) are “people of color”, and uniformly working class. These are the people the leftists claim to fight for. So who is being served by working class people, many racial minorities, being attacked on the job only to see no justice for the perpetrators? How is this racial justice, or justice of any kind? The answer is it’s not, and the left doesn’t care. It was never about helping people.

The left often dismisses this, but drug use is dangerous for all involved. The user runs a very high risk of hospitalization and death from overdose or complications. Meanwhile, bystanders run the risk of biohazard contamination and even overdose, themselves—fentanyl is so dangerous and concentrated that it can cause an overdose from contact with a person’s skin.

Dr. King is probably rolling in his grave, as this is no less than a complete contradiction of everything he dedicated his life to achieving. The Civil Rights campaigners of the 1960s were not looking to continue segregation as long as it was to elevate non-white above whites. And they certainly weren’t struggling to continue keeping race at the forefront of all human interactions in this country. They wanted to create society in which people did not divide each other up by race, where race did not matter, where only “the content of their character” was the basis of judging and treating others. The Critical Social Justice movement wants to tear all of that down. They want to divide by race. They want to turn back the clock and favor some races (with increased opportunity) over others. This is clearly morally bankrupt, and it is stunning how many people are unable to discern that.

The comprehensive poll shows that Biden is losing the confidence of Americans, and fast. A majority of Americans doubt Biden’s mental fitness to serve as president. His ratings on economic handling are still underperforming Trump’s. And then when the pollsters pitted Biden against Trump, Trump came out on top. How is it Democrats still think they’re on the right track? How is it they insist to us that they’re doing a good job, and that we’re stupid if we can’t tell (i.e. agree with their delusional statement)? And this is an indictment of the Democrats, not just Biden specifically: in a hypothetical match-up between Trump and Vice President Harris, Trump wins by an even wider margin (10 points vs. 4 points). When will the Democrats stop insisting they’re doing a great job when most Americans disagree, and change course to start doing better?

As California law currently stands, the therapist must be able to prove that the child is either (a) a danger to themselves or others or (b) is the victim of child abuse. However, the new bill would strike this language, allowing a therapist to simply pass judgment themselves, with no oversight, as to whether to remove a child from the custody of their legal parents or guardians. How is this not ripe for abuse by unscrupulous psychological “professionals”? More importantly, how can changing the law in this way even remotely be justified? What kind of person thinks it should be easier for therapists to take children from their families? The answer is Democrats. They have gone from being simply “smug liberals” to thinking that Americans who don’t agree with them should have their children taken away, that they (the Democrats) should be raising your children instead. How sick is that? 
2023-03-26;https://www.axios.com/2023/03/26/comer-trump-manhattan-da-investigation;authoritarianism;The Republicans are, once again, being reasonable over the Trump indictment by suggesting that the Justice Department take over the prosecution. The Republicans are not all calling for the charges to be dropped (though some are). Rather, they are asking that a more credible third-party, over which they can provide oversight via Congress, assume control of the investigation. This is a reasonable compromise. Yet the Democrats won’t go for it, instead letting their radical New York prosecutor throw the book at Trump.
2023-03-28;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/28/covid-19-who-says-no-extra-booster-needed-for-medium-risk-adults;COVID;After screaming at everyone and insisting that everyone must take COVID mRNA booster shots, the WHO is now walking that back and saying that those who are not high-risk do not require them. It’s almost like this change in recommendation is the WHO admitting that the boosters don’t work. And these are the supposed “reformulated” boosters which are tuned for more recent prevalent strains of SARS-CoV-2. If the “vaccines” are so effective, and COVID so dangerous, why is it that the WHO is not advocating for everyone to get the boosters? The boosters never worked and the only best that can be said for the original mRNA shot, in light of real data, is that it worked on the wild type (original strain), lost effectiveness in light of Delta, and never regained effectiveness. Admissions by public health bodies are slowly corroborating what the data-armed skeptics have always been saying. 
2023-03-29;https://www.axios.com/2023/03/29/uptick-chinese-migrants-southern-border;national security;There is a massive surge in Chinese illegal migrants crossing into the US from its southern land border with Mexico. The explanation supplied by the media is that they are escaping the draconian policies of the Chinese Communist Party. This is likely true, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only reason for it. The People’s Republic of China has been an oppressive country since its founding in 1949, from which millions have fled. So why is the US only just NOW seeing waves of Chinese illegal immigrants? Is it because China has become especially and uniquely oppressive in the last couple of years? One could argue yes, due to their iron-fisted COVID protocols. But given the geopolitical climate, there is probably more to it than people fleeing oppression. China has sent surveillance devices flying over American airspace. China has also been skimming closer and closer to Taiwanese maritime territory. Clearly, China is assuming a bellicose posture. It would be likely in the extreme that the CCP is also mixing in Chinese state agents, spies, and saboteurs in with the fleeing refugees. In fact, China would be stupid not to. Especially if the flow of illegal Chinese migrants is organic, all the more reason to mix in Chinese intelligence assets. That way, they can hide in plain sight, mixing into the overwhelming numbers of legitimate asylum seekers. And of course, due to Biden’s incompetent immigration policies, he is probably letting these Chinese agents right into the country. The near certainty of Chinese migrant infiltration should underscore just what a disastrous job Biden is doing keeping our nation safe (if the forfeiture of American airspace to the Chinese surveillance craft was not enough of an indication). 
2023-03-30;https://thepostmillennial.com/far-left-activists-students-storm-state-house-to-demanding-more-gun-control-in-tennessee;authoritarianism;Leftist protesters stormed the Tennessee state legislature, but of course no one in the media is calling them “insurrectionists”, or even “rioters”. The appreciable difference between their actions and those of January 6 Rioters was that they were not protesting in response to the administering of an election. But otherwise their actions were the same: they stormed onto government property and interrupted the business of the duly elected legislature. However, security did not draw guns on them nor shoot them. However, few, if any, of the leftist protesters in Tennessee will be arrested, and it is unlikely that any will face serious legal consequences. This is because of the authoritarian climate the left has established in the US in which the intimidation and violence of the left is tolerated, while the objections (however peaceful) of the right are censored and politically persecuted. 
2023-03-30;https://www.census.gov/library/visualizations/2023/comm/percent-change-in-county-population.html;authoritarianism;US Census data shows that Americans are fleeing Democrat-controlled states, and the US-Mexico border region. Analyzing the data visualization yields a few revealing trends. Though there are exceptions (such as Washington State), there was a net decrease in population for the most populous counties in California, Wisconsin, and New Jersey, and a net decrease in nearly all counties in Illinois, New Mexico, New York. Meanwhile, in the same 1-year period, there was a net increase in population in the  mos populous counties in Texas, Virginia, and Georgia, and a net increase in nearly all counties in Florida (during which time Republicans controlled the governor’s office), Utah, Arizona, Idaho, Tennessee, and Kentucky. The areas of consistently large decreases in population were along the US-Mexico border, along the Mississippi River, and along the Gulf of Mexico. It is hard to reach any other interpretation of this data besides that of Americans leaving blue states in droves to seek refuge where their liberties will be respected. The Democrats ought to tell us all how it is they’re doing such a great job if their states are losing population left and right.
2023-03-30;https://www.axios.com/2023/03/30/trump-indicted-manhattan-grand-jury-criminal;authoritarianism;The criminal charges against Trump were finally unveiled, prosecuting him for what Democrats and Republicans routinely do without suffering any consequences. Remember when the Democrats cried “in America, we don’t prosecute our political opponents!” (in response to Trump’s calls to prosecute Clinton for an extremely serious breach in national security)? Where is that rhetoric now? See, it turns out the Democrats will invoke any principle of decorum and then violate it as soon as they can benefit from it. The Democrats don’t believe in some sacred prohibition on prosecuting presidents—what they believe is that it’s inappropriate to prosecute DEMOCRAT presidents, but that Republicans are fair game. How is this anything other than naked authoritarianism? Even if Trump broke the law, it was not a serious act of wrongdoing. He is accused of merely using the wrong pool of money to bring about a personal contractual agreement to prevent reputational damage. No one got hurt, and his campaign donors would have arguably been just fine with him using money to keep the lid on infidelity so that he had a better chance of winning election. But because the manner in which he allegedly did so violated campaign finance, the Democrats are coming after him. And of course, they’re pretending as though they don’t break campaign finance laws all the time. Literally every national-level politician does it. They should all be prosecuted, of course. But that Trump is being singled out is the authoritarianism. The law is being weaponized by the dominant party to target a rival politician. This is what fascist countries do.

2023-03-30;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1641515207649288202;authoritarianism;The left, which claims to hate police, shows strong majority support for all the federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies which they are trying to weaponize to hunt down the political right. There was a time when the left was, quite justifiably, skeptical of the US security state. Now they could not possibly embrace it warmly enough as they have turned it to the aim of persecuting their political rivals. Left-leaning poll respondents showed huge support for the FBI, which is being used to monitor parents who speak in opposition to radical liberal education policy at school board meetings. This same group also showed solid support for the Department of Homeland Security which, though antagonistic to illegal migrants, attempted to form a “disinformation” bureau to censor anyone who expressed dissent from the desired Democrat narrative. If you support the security state specifically on the basis of its use against your political enemies, you are a fascist. Who used the FBI and DHS to censor their political opponents, Trump or Biden? So who are the real fascists, the Republicans who are skeptical of these agencies of the Democrats who are only too eager to sick them on the Republicans? 
2023-03-31;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5Cy64vU6Fb0;authoritarianism;When asked whether the prosecution of Trump in New York was politically motivated, Biden—past whose lips the word “Trump” often issues, usually to blame a personal failing on Trump—refused to say anything about the matter. Any time the American economy or American society takes a downward turn, Biden blames it on Trump. He hasn’t taken responsibility for a single failing or error since becoming president. He has also made it clear on numerous occasions that he thinks Trump is a menace to American democracy. So you would think Biden would relish the chance to say “no, I don’t think this is politically motivated, because in our country, no one is above the law.” Interesting, then, that Biden didn’t say anything like that. He could have even stated something to the effect of “I’m not the New York prosecutor, so I’m not in a position to say whether or not the prosecution is politically motivated”. So if the prosecution wasn’t politically motivated, why didn’t Biden clear the air and simply say so, or say that he didn’t know? Because it obviously IS politically motivated. Everyone knows it. A 9-year-old could reason it out: Trump (maybe) broke the law, and he is getting charged. Biden definitely broke the law (mishandling classified documents) and he is not getting charged, so since the only major difference between the two is political party, politics must be behind the decision. The Democrats are weaponizing the legal system to imprison political opponents. There are few things more fascist than that. 
2023-03-31;https://www.axios.com/2023/03/31/twitter-verification-white-house-biden-check-mark;hypocrisy;The Biden White House, which believes that it is important to use social media to connect with constituents in as many convenient ways as possible, refuses to pay for Twitter account verification under Musk’s new revenue model. It’s not as though the White House never pays for communication platforms, that there is no budget for it. It is virtually guaranteed that it pays for things like pro Zoom subscriptions, etc. So what’s the big deal about paying a very nominal fee for account verification? What’s wrong with companies under new management changing how they do business, including with government customers? The reason is obvious to anyone who hasn’t been living under a rock since Musk bought Twitter: the left has turned completely hostile toward Twitter ever since Musk bought it and vowed to bring free speech to the platform. The left knows deep down that they depend on censorship, so even as they lie through their teeth and sing paeans to free speech, they back away from every meaningful advance toward free speech in actual practice. 
2023-03-31;https://decriminalizeuw.com, https://www.washington.edu/safety/2023/03/27/additional-overnight-security-coming-to-seattle-campus;law enforcement;After acceding to student demands and slashing the police presence on campus, the University of Washington is now responding to a spike in campus crime by hiring armed security guards. This illustrates one of two things about the left, either of which is dangerous on its own. One, it illustrates how stupid the left is that they will campaign against the police and then cry when crime goes up, as though they had no idea that those phenomena were related. Do they really not get this? Any 9-year-old can tell you that when police go down, crime goes up. Somehow the left doesn’t understand what 9-year-olds do. Alternatively, two, it reveals the left’s true objective to privatize security so that they don’t have to spend tax money to secure everyone, but concentrate their funds on securing themselves. Just like “Medicare For All” is the notion of pooling tax dollars and doling out (i.e. redistributing) government-provided health care evenly, police are essentially “Security For All”, taking tax dollars and redistributing police across the community (particularly to those communities most severely impacted by crime). If you think about it like that, the police are the most socialist element of our society. You’d think, then, that the left would love the police. But remember that the Democrats are the party of the rich and the elite. 90%-plus of tech employees, academics, educators, scientists, media figures, and entertainers support the Democrats. These are people who don’t want their tax dollars being spent on securing poor communities, that is, communities where they don’t live. The left is using police killings of black people as a pretext to shut down taxpayer-funded law enforcement so they can redirect their money toward their own private security forces. Better yet, these forces aren’t government controlled, so they can’t be held accountable by voting or investigatory/oversight commissions. These private security forces are free to be as brutal as they want and no one can hold them accountable. This way, the left gets to project the image that they care deeply about “people of color” while fucking those people over and armoring up their communities. No matter which of these dynamics is truly the case, it is bad news for our society. 
2023-03-31;https://www.axios.com/2023/03/31/democrats-staff-safety-trump-indictment;authoritarianism;The Democrats are letting their staffers work from home following the Trump indictment announcement, so they can create the perception that Trump supporters will get violent. There is no threshold the Democrats have to meet to do this. They can simply unilaterally declare that they think their staffers are in danger and announce a policy to protect them. There doesn’t have to be any actual risk to their safety. It is certainly possible that there is real risk. But it’s also possible that they’re just saying this to make Trump and his supporters appear more dangerous than they are. Classic Democrat fascist: advance propaganda that the other side is violent. 
2023-03-31;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/3/31/spanish-pm-urges-chinas-xi-to-speak-with-ukraines-zelenskyy;geopolitics;The leader of a major Western developed nation has asked Chinese president Xi Jinping, and not Biden, to intervene in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Again, China is quickly usurping the US as the preeminent world peacekeeper. If the prime minister of Spain had more faith in Biden to resolve the Ukraine-Russia conflict, he would have asked for Biden’s help. Instead, he turned to China’s leader. It is clear to all that the US is too invested in one of the conflict’s belligerents to have any credibility in negotiations. How sad is that when leaders of developed nations think that China is more impartial than the US when it comes to diplomacy? This failure of confidence in the US happened squarely under Biden. Even Trump was a better peace broker, as evidenced by his willingness to meet with North Korea’s Kim, to attempt to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace, and to discuss terms with the Taliban.
2023-03-31;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1641918210801844224;authoritarianism;Greenwald defines the 3 hallmarks of authoritarianism—imprisonment of opposing political actors, empowering and exhorting corporations to censors on their behalf, and adulation for the security state—and then points out that it is clear to all that the Democrats possess all 3. There are numerous examples to support each criterion. The Democrats meet the first criterion in their numerous attempts to prosecute Trump for violations of which they are also guilty but which are never prosecuted, and in their imprisonment of a politically-right meme-maker with election fraud where they declined to charge a politically-left meme-maker with nearly identical (but politically opposite) content. The Democrats meet the second criterion as demonstrated by numerous Twitter Files reports publishing emails and other messages of Biden officials asking Twitter to silence those with a disfavored view on COVID (among many other topics). Finally, Democrats meet the third criterion by simple polling data that shows a majority of Democrats today support DHS, which Bush-era Democrats decried as a menace to freedom, even as it enforces immigration laws that many Democrats oppose. True, Trump called for Clinton’s prosecution, so one major Republican meets that requirement. But which Republican has called on social media to censor their opponents? Who wasn’t able to protest Trump who wanted to from 2017 to 2020? And which Republicans love the security state unconditionally? The Republicans are far from perfect, but they are at least not authoritarians. There was a time when Americans could expect authoritarianism to be completely anathema to any mainstream political party. But here we are, when the most mainstream party warmly embraces authoritarianism, and then has the audacity to accuse their opponents of being the “real” authoritarians.

The Democrats love to insist how they win elections fair and square, and then a very different truth starts to trickle out (after it’s too late, of course). And don’t the Democrats say that democracy is sacred, and that they stand against foreign meddling in elections. How do they explain Obama’s foreign campaign funding streams, then? The Democrats pursued a witch hunt into the Trump-Russia collusion hoax on shakier evidentiary ground than DiCaprio’s testimony. But of course, the Democrats will dismiss such criticisms as “election denialism”, whereas their concocted foreign collusion conspiracies are “serious threats to our democracy” that require every ounce of available investigatory resources. Notice how real Democrat cheating is a hoax, but fake Republican cheating is a serious threat? Explain how that isn’t authoritarianism, Democrats.

2023-04-03;https://twitter.com/OversightPR/status/1642983655470407682;authoritarianism;Documents obtained by FOIA of the FBI show that the FBI regards as “violent extremism” a large and incredibly varied group of men who hold dissenting views from feminist politics. So-called “incels” encompass a wide range of mostly men, but are characterized by exhibited depressive behavior and pessimism about heterosexual romance and dating. A very small number of “incels” have been linked to violence against women. But literally every group imaginable, especially those which center on perceived victimhood, have a tiny fraction of members who are violent. The left more broadly has Antifa, a decentralized movement which wholly endorses violence in support of left-wing causes. In fact, Anitfa as a proportion of the American political left is probably larger, in percentage and absolute numbers, than the proportion of “incels” who support violence. But, yet somehow the FBI think the best use of its time is place all “incels” under suspicion (and, thus, domestic spying) but not Antifa. Antifa has wrested city blocks away from sovereign democratically elected municipal governments, beaten peaceful protesters, set fire to federal government building, and shot law enforcement officers with lethal intent. How does the worst “incel” violence come anywhere close to this? How are “incels” the “real” threat to Americans’ safety—the real worthy investment of the FBI’s time and resources—compared to Antifa? Only in an America where the FBI is effectively the Stasi for the Democrats. The incel movement is a threat to the Democrats’ feminism project, an indicator of the profound psychological distress that comes from relentlessly elevating women to a higher status than men. The Incel movement is a response to the very real, data-supported rise in men’s rates of isolation and suicide. But instead of treating this as the social issue it is and treating it with a mental health campaign, the Democrats think the best treatment is to make any man with an empathetic view toward incel men the target of federal law enforcement. This is the essence of despotism: criminalize and neutralize your political opponents using state coercive power. The Nazis and the Soviets did this with their secret police forces. The Chinese Communist Party does so to this day. The American Democrats are following the same playbook. If an individual commits violence, whether aligned with the incel movement, any other movement (of any political partisanship), or no movement, that individual should be prosecuted. But when speech makes you a suspect, as it has here, that is when society is no longer free. Far-left extremists are allowed to say whatever they want, while overwhelmingly peaceful center-right supporters are hunted down by the state. Explain how that isn’t left-wing authoritarianism. 
2023-04-04;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/4/former-us-president-trump-faces-34-charges-in-historic-first;authoritarianism;The Democrats have broken a precedent as old as our nation and finally gone through with what they condemned Trump for so much as hinting at: prosecuting a political opponent. The Democrats can never again claim “we don’t prosecute our political opponents!” That is still true of Republicans, but it is no longer true of Democrats. Funny how the Democrats were the ones to make this declaration, and yet they broke it only a few years later. Does anyone need more proof that the Democrats stand for nothing? How is this anything other than an effort to keep Trump from challenging Biden? Isn’t it interesting that this is timed right Trump is emerging ahead of Biden (or any other hypothetical Democrat) in the polls? And yet the Democrats want us to believe that there is no link here, that they’re just upholding the law. They sure don’t seem to uphold the law when it comes to their own. They accused Trump of being a rapist, insisting that we should “believe all women” yet when a woman made the same accusation against Biden, she was silenced and subjected to a media hit job. Anyone with a brain can tell this is not about justice, it’s about politics. The Democrats are not above manipulating the law for their own partisan ends. The Democrats are party above country all the way. Again, funny how they love to accuse Republicans of this when the Democrats do it the most.

Worse yet, when pressed by the left-leaning New York Times on why Biden wouldn’t comment on this criminal proceeding when he did not hesitate to do so about January 6 defendants, she gave a weak answer about how January 6th’s broken precedent but not this one, she waxed on about how January 6 was a threat to the US democracy, as though Trump’s case is somehow plainly not. If the extremely left-leaning New York Times thinks that Trump’s case could carry implications for our democracy, there’s a good chance it will. Yet Biden for some reason does not want to help guide the conversation. Didn’t he say how critical it was to safeguard democracy? Why is he shrinking from this sacred duty now, I wonder? Could it possibly be because he knows that this is a politically motivated prosecution, which he benefits from, and thus would never dream of doing anything to disparage it? 
2023-04-04;https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/4/5/frances-macron-visits-china-seeking-breakthrough-in-ukraine-war;geopolitics;Yet another leader of a major developed nation, one which is intimately integrated into the US’s alliance structure, is calling on China to negotiate an end to the Ukraine-Russia conflict where this leader clearly has no faith in the US’s ability or willingness to do the same. The media is emphasizing that Macron is exhorting Xi to talk Russia down from prosecuting the war further. But as we all know, negotiations go both ways. If China persuades Russia into a ceasefire, it also has to persuade Ukraine into one, with both sides likely giving concessions. Macron and the media can spin Russia as the bad guy all they want, but it doesn’t change the fact that they are reinforcing China’s position as the new preeminent world peace mediator, dethroning the US. Only Biden and the Democrats could so quickly and carelessly let this soft power and prestige that America has long held slip away for nothing. Biden would rather that China become the world’s beacon of peace than risk letting his worthless, drug addict son’s cash cow, Ukraine, get swallowed up by Russia.

Does anyone think that radical beliefs like this are fitting qualities for a mayor whose job it is to keep the public safe? Leftists claim that they have the utmost confidence in leaders with such views, but they would probably be singing a different tune if they found themselves the victims of violence. How is it that people are OK with a mayor whose views on public safety a 9-year-old could find fundamental logical flaws with? How safe does anyone think Chicago will be without police? The rich (mostly white) leftists who voted this guy in will have no problem, as they will continue to just divert their saved tax dollars (without police) to private armed security answerable only to them. It’s the poor, mostly nonwhite demographics of the city who will suffer without any force to maintain order and stop violence in their communities. How does this help racial minorities at all? How much longer will the Democrats try to dupe us with the lie that they care about “people of color”?

The Democrats couldn’t just admit that they didn’t have a case on Trump. Instead they contorted the law until a cynical stretch of a reading could bury Trump in felony charges. This is not the behavior of people who merely want justice upheld, but that of partisans weaponizing the law to imprison their political opponents. And it also shows how desperate they are to take down Trump. They’d rather risk unveiling a transparently far-fetched legal theory that makes it clear to all that the prosecution is political, rather than face Trump in an election. Their prosecution makes 2 audacious leaps in legal logic: first, that every payment Trump made to his lawyer constituted 3 felony offenses, and second, that the New York state law criminalizing hiding of fraudulent transactions can be applied to the supposedly broken federal law of campaign finance fraud. If the Republicans were prosecuting a Democrat with this kind of shaky legal theory, the left would be rioting in every major city in America. But with the shoe on the other foot, the right is not rioting, but only mounting very minor and tame protests. This just goes to show what an authoritarian force the left is. They are free to use the law to destroy the political right and the right meekly takes it, while the right tries to actually enforce law and order on the left every once in a blue moon and the left goes ballistic. Who are the real fascists here? It couldn’t be clearer. 
2023-04-05;https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/decline-in-day-to-day-school-violence;authoritarianism;In spite of media fixation on the rare (and, of course, tragic) phenomenon that is school shootings, a new study shows that violence in schools in California has declined, and continues to do so. The Democrat-subservient media has developed an obsession with school shootings, portraying them as a commonplace scourge on society. But the actual data (as usual) from California schools disproves the left-wing myth of routine school shootings—there is no reason to believe that California schools are an exception, and that all other schools are seeing increased violence. In fact, it suggests that violence is probably dropping faster in other schools, since California schools are more likely to be free of police presence (since the Democrats are openly hostile to law enforcement, unless that law enforcement is hunting down their political opponents, of course). Not only are school shootings an increasingly rare event in schools, but violence in general is trending downward in schools. Yet again, the left is trying to sell Americans a lie so they can advance their radical agenda. For the “Party of Science”, the Democrats sure don’t seem to ever follow the data.

The US government literally has a line item in its budget to give money to NPR. That is the very definition of state-affiliated. Why should foreign nations’ state-funded media be labeled as such, but not the US’s? How is that a fair application of the content moderation standards on the platform? This was exactly Musk’s point in purchasing Twitter: that the American left and its allies were held to one set of standards, and everyone else was held to much more stringent standards. Whatever the standards are, at least as Twitter explicitly states them, they should be applied to everyone equally no matter their class, political affiliation, or any other characterization. The fact that the left is vehemently protesting this reveals that they don’t believe in fairness. They never have. They believe rules are for other people to follow. They believe that state and social institutions are theirs to wield against their opponents. This is the essence of authoritarianism, and it is woven into the fabric of the political left at every level.

Don’t leftists constantly profess how THEY are the ones who believe in the utmost compassion for everyone? Then why didn’t they help this man, one of their own, as he was dying? Maybe it’s because, once they realized he was white (and rich) they thought it would be better if there was one less white man in the world (so he would stop being racist by his mere existence). It turns out that leftists are all selfish cowards. They would rather let someone die than inconvenience themselves, and then they go on the next day and talk about how compassionate they are. This is how you know every leftist talking point is utter bullshit: they talk nonstop about compassion and then implement policies which, in the final full analysis, only enrich themselves and immiserate everyone else, ESPECIALLY the less-privileged groups they most profess to stand for. The Republicans may not openly state that they stand for the ordinary American, but their policies are definitely a lot closer to helping them than the wealth-plundering policies of the Democrats.

2023-04-05;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/5/man-kills-four-children-in-axe-attack-at-brazilian-daycare;gun control;The Democrats love to pretend that mass killings will stop if guns are eliminated, but there are examples of mass killings all around the world that don’t involve guns. The problem is not guns but people who want to kill. If they can’t use guns, they’ll use axes. If they can’t use axes, they’ll use cars. If they can’t use cars, they’ll use knives. If they can’t use knives, they’ll use hammers. Do you get the idea, leftists? Does anyone seriously want to propose outlawing all these tools? Of course not. That would be idiotic. The one point on which Democrats are actually right is the call for increased mental health access. The only problem is that many Democrats believe that the funding for government-provided mental health resources should come from reduced law enforcement budget. Law enforcement can be maintained while also spending more on mental health. If society reduces the desire to kill, killings will decrease.

Now, the left will immediately jump at this and say “well, there’s no evidence she’s on the political left”. True, but does anyone really think a 19-year-old woman on TikTok is somehow a Republican? It doesn’t matter that she lives in Mississippi. Plenty of Democrats live in the south. And look what the left tolerates: part of what the LGBT spectrum now embraces are so-called “xenogenders” in which humans sexually identify as animals. How is bestiality not the logical next, modest step from that? So which side of the political spectrum is more inclined toward bestiality, the sexually conservative right or the sexually degenerate left?

It has been established for years now that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is smaller than the pores in most, if not all, medical facial masks. And yet despite this fact, COVID controls apologists continued to invent far-fetched lines of argument to justify why masks were still effective. Now the data is conclusive: masks do nothing to stop the transmission of COVID, and never have. To this day there are institutions and organizations that continue to mandate masks. Some will likely continue to do so. There is absolutely no scientific basis for doing so, especially considering that there are negative consequences for wearing masks, from inducing people to touch their face, to lower oxygen intake, to arrested socio-linguistic development in grade-school students, to the growth of fungus on the face. All of these were dismissed as immaterial compared to the risk of COVID. It turns out the mask zealots were the ones taking a risk. Ironic since they claimed to revere “The Science”, and yet never stopped to consider real science and real data.

What an interesting coincidence that a trans person kills people who are statistically more likely to be conservative (Christians in Tennessee), and then leftists mount a “Trans Day of Vengeance” (which, of course, isn’t canceled for being in poor taste after a trans person kills 6 people), and then another trans kid prepares to mount their own school shooting in a conservative city. Of course, the Democrats will insist that it is just that: a coincidence. Meanwhile, they link every shooting where racial minorities are killed together and claim that they’re all part of a systematic right-wing domestic terror plot. Never mind that, on cursory examination, many of these shootings can be ruled out as being hate-motivated against nonwhite individuals. For example, the Buffalo shooter who killed a dozen black people explicitly stated in his manifesto that he identified as a “left authoritarian” (seems unlikely he was a right-winger, then). For another example, writings recovered from the man who killed Asian women in massage parlors shows that he held a grudge against women who work in massage parlors, not Asian women. So, for those keeping score at home, under the left’s rules, if victims were coincidentally nonwhite or the shooter is a leftist, it’s still part of a right-wing terror movement, but if all the shooters are trans and all the victims are conservatives—all while the left is calling for trans people to exact “vengeance”—then how DARE anyone suggest that there is a left-wing terror movement. Does nobody see where this is going? The left is trying to push us to the ultimate realization of Herbert Marcuse’s “Essay on Repressive Tolerance”: where the left is at liberty to kill their opponents with impunity, and if said opponents dare object in the mildest terms, they are censored, rendered financially destitute, and imprisoned. 
2023-04-06;https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/docs/t9-ath-nprm.pdf;identity;The Biden administration is moving to force all schools in all states to include “trans girls” (who are genetically males and thus benefit from the augmented musculature of human male sexual dimorphism) in girls’ sports, where they will invariably dominate female students in athletics. Imagine what would happen if every school included trans girls on their girls’ sports teams? Female athletes would never be able to reach the highest levels of competition ever again. It is one thing to mandate that there is some athletic outlet for trans girls, but not at the expense of female athletes. Trans girls can have their own league, which would put all competitors on a level playing field, as is the entire rationale behind splitting boys’ from girls’ sports in the first place. In every instance in which a trans girl or woman athlete is admitted into a traditional girls’/women’s league, they dominate the vast majority of competitors, if not outright take first place by a wide margin. Trans swimmer Lia Thomas crushed the competition. Trans UFC fighter Fallon Fox defeated an opponent so brutally that the opponent suffered a fractured skull. Title IX is about fairness. How forcing female athletes to up against males who take some estrogen fair?
2023-04-07;https://apnews.com/article/tennessee-lawmakers-expulsion-d3f40559c56a051eec49e416a7b5dade;authoritarianism;The Tennessee state legislature expelled 2 Democrat members who joined gun control protesters who burst onto the floor of the chamber and disrupted government business. Wasn’t one of the accusations against the January 6 Rioters that they illegally disrupted the business of Congress? How is this any different? Actually, it is different in that the Republicans were much more lenient against the expelled Democrats. Instead of charging them with a crime, they simply kicked them out of office. The seats will probably remain in Democrat hands, as a special election will probably replace the 2 expelled Democrats with 2 different Democrats. So this is not a political ploy by the Republicans because it won’t get them anywhere. It’s about insisting on respect for the institution of government, and hashing out differences using civil debate. There are likely many more Democrat members of the Tennessee legislature who hold the same views on gun control as their expelled colleagues, but the difference is that the former voiced their perspective civilly, and so remain in the legislature. But the rabid left does not acknowledge such critical distinctions. They just see their side suffering consequences for their childish and irreverent actions, so they perceive it as a brutal attack on their politics. So here we see yet another pro-left double-standard: if the right disrupts government business, they go to prison and we all accept it, but if the left disrupts government business and get expelled, the left throws a tantrum.

It should be alarming that a close associate of ANY influential billionaire is visiting the president more than once a month. But it is even more alarming when the billionaire in question is a well-known radical left-wing ideologue. The mainstream press was (rightly) vocal about close associations between Trump and unsavory right-wing figures. But when when Biden is cavorting with known advocates of radical left-wing views, the mainstream press has nothing to say. Interesting how the press will sharply criticize right extremism, but ignore right extremism completely. This is just one more data point showing that the press is the unofficial organ of the Democrats.

According to video evidence alone, Biden has non-consensually touched girls dozens of times. This meets the definition of sexual harassment by any company’s left-leaning HR department standards. If a Trump was caught on camera even ONCE doing what Biden has done numerous times, the Democrats would be starting a new round of impeachment or criminal prosecution. Yet when Biden does it, no one on the left utters the faintest peep of criticism. The Democrats never again get to claim that they care about stopping sexual assault against women, at least not until Biden is behind bars. 
2023-04-10;https://twitter.com/Weaponization/status/1645478587741372431;authoritarianism;A Congressional committee has discovered that the FBI sent at least one undercover agent to at least one Catholic church, with a high likelihood that this was not an isolated incident. As has become unsurprising by now, the Democrats and their loyal state enforcers, the FBI, have made targets out of anyone who dissents. The FBI has targeted parents who oppose the sexually explicit content featured in schools, men who are depressed after feminist-controlled culture tells them they’re the problem (just for being men, which meets the definition of sexism), and now anyone who subscribes to one of the world’s major religions. This is a flagrant violation of the First Amendment, as the Democrats reasonably argued in regards to the FBI infiltration of mosques under Bush. So apparently, according to the left, it’s wrong to spy on Muslims in mosques, but it’s A-OK to spy on Catholics in churches. Under the Democrats, the First Amendment (and the Bill of Rights more broadly) only apply to their favored groups, and are to be denied to disfavored groups. How is this anything other than authoritarian? 
2023-04-10;https://www.axios.com/2023/04/10/justin-jones-tennessee-three-reinstated-nashville;authoritarianism;The Democrats, who claim to be the guardians of democracy, voted back the expelled Tennessee state representative who joined protesters in disrupting the business of fellow duly elected representatives. Republicans in that chamber expelled 3 Democrats who joined with protesters in storming the floor of the chamber and bringing legislative business to a halt, for the reason that such behavior is an affront to democratically elected representatives who have a right to do the public’s business. It also posed an extreme security risk, as the protesters could have been armed and physically harmed the members present. Republicans did not expel all Democrats, nor did they expel anyone purely for their pro-gun control views. They merely expelled those who refused to debate within the civil, established bound of the chamber. The expelled members’ districts were free to elevate another pro-gun control Democrat, so long as that Democrat adhered to the rules of order. Instead, the left-wing constituents of one district re-elected the same individual who was expelled. It is clear that Democrats and their supporters do not respect the democratic process, in which rules are follow so all representatives of the people can be heard. It’s pretty hypocritical when the people who accuse the January 6 rioters of not respecting democracy (in that instance, on some modestly reasonable grounds) not only elect a representative who disrupts legislative business in the same way, but then RE-elects that same representative. Imagine if a Republican in Congress had joined the January 6 rioters, been expelled from Congress, and then was reelected: the Democrats, their supporters, and the press would lose their minds. They would call it terrorism. They would stop at nothing to hunt down that Republican and anyone who supported them. Yet when the shoe is on the other foot and the Democrats do exactly this, disrupting democracy is seen as a noble act. This is the Iron Law of Woke Projection at its clearest: whatever act by the right that the left throws a tantrum over is EXACTLY what the left will insist it has a right to do. Protesters who haven’t gone through a security check storming the legislature is, for the left, OK when the left does it, deserving ruthless prosecution when the left does it. How is this not authoritarianism? This is exactly the behavior of communist dictatorships: the left is allowed to bring down the power of the state on any dissenters, no matter how peaceful.

While the legislator did not state the reason for his change in affiliation, there are no shortage of possible reasons. The Democrats have now become the party of authoritarianism, the party of racism, and the party of lawlessness (as the trove of examples in this archive make undeniably clear). Why would anyone of any moral character associate with the Democrats? The trend in the last couple of years has been for figures to leave the Democrats, not the Republicans. Gabbard and Sinema also both left the Democrats to register as independents. If the Republicans were the evil, authoritarian party, wouldn’t the trend be for Republicans to leave and become Democrats? If the Democrats are so noble, just, and true, why are they losing so many members? 
2023-04-11;https://www.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/immigrant-health/asylum-seeker-dear-colleague.pdf;immigration;The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has advised city doctors that illegal migrants are likely missing key immunizations, including those which are considered essential and have impeccable safety records. The letter notes that roughly 50,000 illegal migrants have arrived in New York in the last year, a massive influx by any measure. Regardless of what the Democrat-dominated city elects to do, it comes at a cost to American taxpayers. Either these illegal migrants will be vaccinated using public money and resources which could otherwise go to vulnerable Americans (natural-born and naturalized), or they will be left untreated and risk spreading dangerous illnesses to immunocrompromised Americans—didn’t Democrats say they cared SO much about immunocompromised Americans? Moreover, isn’t it interesting that New York coerced American citizens in the city into getting the COVID shot, yet these migrants are exempt from a similar requirement? How does that make any sense? Medical autonomy should extend to everyone, no matter their citizenship or immigration status, but how does it make any sense to accord more freedoms to foreigners who crossed into the country illegally than to Americans (and lawful permanent residents, etc.)? Even by authoritarian Democrat logic, it would make more sense to require EVERYONE to get vaccinations, regardless of immigration status, than to let one group arbitrarily off the hook. If they had migrated legally—whether obtaining naturalization, a green card, a visa, or legal asylum status (which requires paperwork and not just crossing the border and telling a sob story)—there would be nothing objectionable about offering them taxpayer funded public health resources. At the barest of bare minimums, illegal migrants shouldn’t be treated BETTER than Americans. This just shows where Democrats’ priorities are. It helps their wealthy donors to have more illegal migrants, who can be blackmailed into accepting sub-minimum wage.

It turns out Republicans have standards of behavior, to which they hold their own members as well as Democrats. This is more Iron Law of Woke projection: the left are the ones who would use expulsion to destroy the right, and would never expel their own member no matter how grave the offense. They won’t even verbally criticize Biden for groping underage girls, so it is clear they have no morals whatsoever. Instead the left spreads the lie that Republicans have no morals, only for the lie to be readily exposed.

This is more evidence that the Democrats don’t respect democracy, despite histrionically claiming the contrary.

2023-04-12;https://www.axios.com/2023/04/12/house-democrats-winning-wealthier-districts-middle-class-gop;identity;Voting patterns continue to trend toward the Republicans being the party of the working class, and the Democrats being the party of the wealthy. The data undeniably illustrates that the Democrats are the party of the elites: FEC filings show that the vast majority of employees at the top tech companies donate to Democrats, and polling shows that most journalists, entertainers, academics, and educators support the Democrats. In 2020, Biden won Georgia because he secured the wealthy suburban counties surrounding Atlanta. These are people whose cultural and social preferences differ vastly from the those of the working class. The wealthy elites can afford to defund the police and redirect their savings on taxes to private security, while the working class requires police to combat violence in their neighborhoods. The wealthy elites love illegal immigration because it gives them access to a workforce they can blackmail into accepting sub-minimum wage (or face deportation), while the working class is made of these very blackmailed immigrants or must race to the bottom of the earning scale to compete with them for employment (Sanders, to his credit, agrees with this, stating that open borders favor the elites). The Democrats’ policies don’t help the working class at all, yet they have the audacity to lie in claiming to stand for them. This lie is revealing itself more and more with every poll and every election, though. When this happens, though, the Democrats resort to race-baiting, pitting race against race in spite of their common heritage as Americans. The radical left of yesteryear saw through this as the pro-elite ploy it is: Bill Ayers worked to unite working-class whites and blacks who were encouraged by the wealthy elites to hate each other and not unite against the elites. So who is really on the side of the working American: the Republicans, who don’t play the identity politics game and instead focus on the economy and public safety, or the Democrats, who let neighborhoods descend into lawlessness and turn race against race while they line their pockets?

If the media’s portrait of the “incel” man was accurate, that they view women as the source of their romantic failures, then “incel” men should be LESS likely to blame themselves for said failures. But instead, the real science shows the opposite is true. “Incel” men are more likely to see the answer to their problems in self-improvement, which is something everyone should be able to get behind. So why is the media perpetuating the myth that incels blame women for all of their problems? Because the media serves the Democrats, and the Democrats serve the feminists, and the feminists cannot stand the fact that their agenda is being shown to be as destructive to society as it is. The mainstreaming of misandry (hatred of men, which spell-checking software doesn’t even think is a real word!) by feminists correlates with men developing addictions, becoming clinically depressed, and killing themselves at higher rates than ever before. But they can never let this fact enter the mainstream American consciousness, so they order their loyal servants in the media to paint men who are skeptical of the feminist cultural ascendancy as the problem. 
2023-04-12;https://www.axios.com/2023/04/12/dianne-feinstein-resign-absence-judges;authoritarianism;The Democrats are so heartless, and so hostile to democracy, that many of them are demanding that one of their own members step down because her medical leave is costing them votes in the Senate. The state of California duly chose Feinstein to represent them in the highest legislature in the land. That is their democratic will. But because Democrats aren’t getting what they want, they dismiss Californians’ democratic will as irrelevant and inconvenient. To Democrats, the self-appointed “Defenders of Democracy”, the democratic process means nothing. They will kick out one of their own whom millions voted for just so they can get their way. This is a trend in the Democratic Party, and why the Democrats are no friends of democracy. In 2016, the party elites used everything in their power to keep Sanders from winning their party nomination. The very fact that the Democratic Party uses “superdelegates”, party elites who can cast votes on par with electoral votes from state primary elections, shows that they have no respect for the popular will. Meanwhile, the Republicans allowed n outsider, Trump, to compete fairly among them, and they respected the outcome when he won their nomination. Democracy means nothing to Democrats when it stands between them and their agenda. It’s high time the Democrats explain to Americans how exactly the Republicans are the ones who hate democracy. 
2023-04-12;https://seymourhersh.substack.com/p/trading-with-the-enemy;corruption;According to one of the most distinguished journalists of our time, Hersh, Ukrainian officials are embezzling millions of dollars from the aid sent by the US. What a coincidence: Ukraine’s Burisma (an oil company) pays Hunter Biden (who does not have any subject matter expertise on oil) millions of dollars, and then Biden hands Ukrainian officials (some of the most corrupt in the Western world) millions of dollars to skim. It sure looks like quid pro quo to anyone capable of rational thought. But even if, against all odds, that’s not what’s going on, it still shows that Biden is too stupid to keep from wasting American aid dollars. He should have realized that officials in the infamously corrupt Ukrainian government would skim money, and taken steps to prevent this from happening. But the entire premise behind America’s massive involvement in the conflict, along with sticking it to Russia for supposedly single-handedly making Trump president (a victory which the Democrats deny had ANYTHING to do with Clinton being the least likable candidate in generations), is protecting the Biden family cashflow. Providing aid money which you KNOW will be embezzled is theft, specifically of American tax dollars. Democrats went on and on about Trump’s corruption, so they really ought to explain how this isn’t significantly worse corruption than anything Trump may or may not have done.

Most Americans do not want troops in Ukraine. Biden indicated he would honor these wishes, and then betrayed that promise when he thought no one was looking. And again, it is proven that he and his family have a personal stake in Ukraine: a Ukrainian oil company is paying his son, who knows nothing about oil, so if Ukraine falls, that income dries up. So Biden is not only violating Americans’ wishes in putting troops in Ukraine, but he is risking escalation with a nuclear armed state in that state’s sphere of influence, all so his son can make a buck. Explain, Democrats, how this isn’t worse than the worst thing Trump ever did.

Instead of bailing out these 2 banks to cover them until they could produce enough liquid assets (they had the assets, but they simply couldn’t liquidate them fast enough to cover demand), Biden’s Treasury let the banks collapse and then facilitated their sale to larger banks. So large banks like Chase saw their mid-sized competition, with the help of the Biden administration, tank and get absorbed into larger banks.

2023-04-15;https://nypost.com/2023/04/15/jim-jordan-says-biden-prosecution-is-likely/;authoritarianism;Republicans are claiming to already hear from right-leaning local district attorneys that, because of the Trump prosecution in New York, they are planning on prosecuting Biden. America had a stable equilibrium in its political system when all participants honored the unspoken agreement not to prosecute sitting or former presidents. True, it left the door open for certain abuses, but it had the important benefit of limiting the arenas in which political squabbling could take place. While this understanding technically gave presidents a blank check to engage in lawbreaking, this pitfall was seen as more than outweighed by the stability granted by not weaponizing the law against political opponents in the highest office. Thus, presidents had the breathing room to govern, an especially important outcome once the Untied States rose to superpower status and had a just and peaceful world order to help maintain. In prosecuting Trump, the Democrats opened an extremely perilous Pandora’s Box. Now, every president from here on out is fair game for local prosecutors to try to tear down. Granted, this report is an instance of “he said, she said”, but there is no reason to think this isn’t happening. There are thousands of local DAs across the country, so it is likely that at least a handful of them have come around to this way of thinking. And of course, why wouldn’t the Republicans retaliate? In today’s American political culture, largely shaped by the Democrats, there is no reason to pull punches, there is nothing to be gained from taking the moral high ground. If Republicans don’t respond to Democrats in kin (in regards to prosecuting presidents), it would be their own unilateral disarmament, putting them at the Democrats’ mercy. What the Democrats start, they cannot be surprised or outraged that the Republicans finish. If they didn’t want a prosecution of Biden, they shouldn’t have prosecuted Trump. As always, the Democrats are the first to push the envelope, so they are at fault. If the Republicans had made the first move, then the Democrats would be justified in crying foul. But the left’s modus operandi is to see how much they can get away with, so of course they crossed the line first.

If the economy were just fine, shouldn’t that not be happening? Biden is so stupid that he doesn’t understand that his decision to extend FDIC insurance to all deposits just encourages the very thing he is (or at least claims to be and should be) trying to stop: bank runs. If you cover one bank run, it signals to depositors that you’ll cover all bank runs. And because the conditions that inspired the bank run haven’t improved, there was already desire to pull money from banks. Same preexisting desire to run on banks plus increased chances of the success of a bank run equals more bank runs. A 9-year-old could’ve deduced that much, yet somehow the president of the United States just couldn’t see that coming. Does that sound like good leadership to anyone who can think rationally? Or is it that he’s not stupid and this is part of a strategy? It sure is interesting the way that the depositors who flee from regional banks seem to go running to big banks, banks which donate extensively to Democrats. How does anyone trust the Democrats to side with ordinary Americans?

How is the Secretary of Education supposed to enforce Title IX to prevent discrimination against women if he can’t define what a woman is? I thought Democrats were vehemently against sexism. They’re going to have a tough job stopping sexism if they are unable (or unwilling) to define the sexes. More importantly, how is it not sexist to steadfastly refuse to define the term “woman”? The left loves to talk about “erasure” of their identity group. How is refusing to define “woman” anything other than an erasure of women? This is only further proof that the Democrats simply use and discard identity groups to further their ends. Women don’t matter to Democrats, only what wielding women as a political instrument can gain for them. It’s hard to think of anything more sexist than this increasingly common attitude among Democrats. 
2023-04-19;https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/Senate%20Passed%20Legislature/5599-S.PL.pdf;identity;The state of Washington has passed a bill that allows shelters for transgender youth to withhold the child’s whereabouts from their parents. The sole purpose of this bill is to drive a wedge between parents and children who identify as transgender. Children are not allowed to consent to many activities which adults are perfectly free to do. For instance, children cannot drink, join the military, consent to sexual intercourse. This is because society has traditionally held the uncontroversial and scientifically supported view that children do not have the cognitive development to make serious life choices for themselves. There are activities which children cannot consent to but which they may still undertake as long as their parents provide proxy consent. If a child is truly set on undergoing a gender transition, and their parents are supportive, there is nothing stopping the parents from providing proxy consent to such medical procedures. The whole point of this legal age of consent construct is to prevent children from unilaterally making life-altering decisions which they may later come to regret. So who does this bill serve? Children whose parents have misgivings about gender transition serious enough to withhold consent. Now, however, Washington state is signaling to children that, if they wan to transition and their parents withhold consent, they can just run away and the state will hold them hostage from their parents until their parents consent to the procedure. If there truly IS serious abuse in the family, there is already a mechanism for a child to request foster care or (if they are old enough) emancipate themselves. Parents are duly notified, and have the right to legal proceeding and appeal, but the child is still afforded recourse from abuse. But with this bill, children who want to gender transition against the judgment of their parents have a fast track that circumvents the process of foster care, emancipation, etc. Transgenderism is demonstrably a fad among young people, a fad which many of them will come to regret, and instead of allowing parents to serve as the check on dangerous fads that they have been for centuries, the Democrats of Washington state see it as their duty to enable this fad... a fad which overwhelmingly benefits the Democrats. Democrats are not above enabling children to flee parents into the arms of the state. It bears noting that the authoritarian movements of the 20th century, fascism and communism, both encouraged the youth to declare their first allegiance to the party, above that to their parents. And these horrifying movements flourished precisely to the degree that they were successful in driving children from their parents arms and into the party’s. How is Washington state’s Democrats, via this soon-to-become-law, any different? 
2023-04-17;https://twitter.com/paulajean2020/status/1648125352890314752;authoritarianism;Yet another politician has left the Democrats to join the Republicans (this time in battleground state West Virginia). If the Democrats are so righteous, and the Republicans are so clearly the party of bigotry and fascism, then why are so many Democrats switching to the Republican party? In fact, if the Democrats’ narrative was true, there shouldn’t be ANYONE joining the Republicans. And yet there are. Most people know fascism when they see it. Most Americans are against it. There must be something really wrong with the Democrats if they yell “fascist!” at the Republicans and yet still lose party members to the GOP. 
2023-04-20;https://www.racket.news/p/house-democrats-have-lost-their-minds;authoritarianism;The Democrats are now threatening journalist Taibbi, who exposed their censorship coordination with Twitter, with prison based on the fabrications of their media attack dog Hasan. As part of his Twitter Files reporting, Taibbi erroneously conflated two agencies, CIS and CISA. As the basis for his Congressional testimony, Taibbi referenced the whole body of his Twitter Files work. When he had the mistake pointed out to him, he hastily corrected it. More importantly, although the particulars of that one tweet were incorrect (and only unintentionally so), he maintained that this error was immaterial to the substance of his testimony to Congress: he maintains that if any of his statements were challenged, he would be able to provide a document in his possession which established the veracity of his statements. And even so, the law against perjury before Congress is not intended to persecute journalists for every mistake, but to prevent the intentional covering up of serious truths, to the harm of the American people. Taibbi neither broke the letter nor spirit of the law. The only reason Democrats are seizing on a minor factual error to try and get Taibbi for perjury is because he exposed their illegal authoritarian censorship. The Democrats raked Trump over the coals for calling journalists “the enemy of the people”. Explain, Democrats, how threatening a journalist with prison isn’t significantly worse. What the Democrats have done in threatening Taibbi is exactly what authoritarian countries like China and Russia do. 
2023-04-20;https://twitter.com/JudiciaryGOP/status/1649202188684611584;elections;Former Deputy Director of the CIA Morell testified that he was asked by the Biden campaign to write a statement that suggested the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation, and get other current or former US intelligence community officials to sign it. Morell’s sworn statement is nothing short of the smoking gun that Biden cheated in the 2020 election: in this case, by using the credibility of current and former government officials—government officials whose careers he helped advance over his years in the Obama White House and the US Senate—to advance a lie to the American public that would help get him elected. If Trump had done anything even remotely approaching this, the left would be rioting in the streets and the Democrats would have immediately impeached him. They did just that over the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, which was shown to have no basis in evidence. This is the most egregious act of election interference since Watergate. The Democrats are never allowed to claim to stand for election integrity ever again. 
2023-04-21;https://www.racket.news/p/news-blackout-in-effect;authoritarianism;Congressional Republicans have released evidence of the biggest election scandal since Watergate, and yet nearly all of the mainstream media has no coverage of this. The media constantly chafes at the accusation that they’re just Democrat lapdogs, insisting that they follow big stories no matter who it damages. OK, so if that’s true, where are all the stories on the Morell testimony that a representative of the Biden campaign asked him to go on the record to suggest that the Hunter Biden laptop story was Russian disinformation? In a world of unbiased press, every news outlet would be all over this story. And yet somehow only conservative news is running with it. Explain, press, how you’re NOT just servants of the Democrats. 
2023-04-22;https://www.foxnews.com/video/6325701473112;economy;A Democrat challenger to Biden for the presidential nomination, Kennedy, has pointed out that the COVID lockdowns which his party pushed most aggressively transferred immense wealth from the middle class to the (already) extremely wealthy. Kennedy is also challenging the mainstream, left-driven view of the effectiveness of the COVID “vaccines”. He cites data showing that the US, which has only 4% of the world’s population but one of the highest COVID shot rates, had 16% of the world’s COVID deaths. At the same time, countries with nearly no uptake of the COVID jab, but were open to repurposing of treatments to treat COVID (such as ivermectin), saw COVID death rates many times lower than the US’s. You know that a president is in rough shape when contenders from within the same party are challenging claims that are central to the president’s governing platform. It will be interesting to see how the party sidelines, hamstrings, and silences Kennedy, who comes from an influential political family, so to preserve their various false narratives: that the lockdowns stopped the spread and didn’t plunder the middle class, that the COVID jab works, and so many others.

Regardless of who the protesters are or what they stand for, if they are peaceful, they have a right to protest. The First Amendment protects all speech, even that which we might find objectionable. The left used to stand for freedom of speech. The left of today, however, attacks those exercising peaceful free speech that dissents from the left. This is the behavior of authoritarians, plain and simple. By and large, the right doesn’t do this—there are always exceptions, of course, but only the left has a stranding street enforcer mob that physically assaults their political opponents. If the left is supposedly on the right side, then how do they justify unprovoked violence on peaceful protesters?

2023-04-25;geopolitics;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/25/putin-ally-we-are-probably-on-the-verge-of-a-new-world-war;Russian elites close to Putin claim that the world is approaching a new world war. It takes two to tango, so this means that there is another belligerent that is escalating toward world war. It is hard to deny that Biden is part of this dangerous escalatory game. Biden is closer than any president since FDR to allowing a world war to happen—at least in FDR’s case America’s participation was provoked from a position of (more or less) neutrality. FDR didn’t push the world toward World War II, as Biden is toward World War III. Biden is the one who brought about the regime change in Ukraine in 2014 that set Russia on a collision course with the West. Biden is the one continuing to corner Russia so that it has no choice but to lash out at countries like Ukraine to reestablish the buffer with the West it was promised in 1989 when the USSR collapsed. Biden is the one who is simultaneously emboldening China to invade Taiwan (by demonstrating American weakness) and vowing to defend Taiwan with American lives. If these aren’t steps on the way to a world war, then nothing is.

The left is now doing precisely the one thing that they can fairly criticize the right for as regards January 6: stopping government business. The left continues mercilessly condemn the right for January 6, yet they are now doing, on what is becoming a regular basis, the worst of what the January 6 Rioters accomplished. In fact, the difference is that the right’s grievances (though NOT their actions) were justified. We now know that the Biden campaign cheated by getting government officials to lie and suggest that incriminating information about Biden and his family was Russian disinformation. The right got riled up about Biden’s cheating and trespassed and stopped federal government business. Meanwhile, the left is disrupting state legislatures because they aren’t getting what they want in a fair and orderly conducting of the legislature’s rules of order. In this case, they were retaliating for Republicans voting to censure a Democrat colleague for disrespectful and inflammatory remarks. How is what the left is now repeatedly doing less egregious than what the right did—not was made out to have meant to do by the left-leaning press, but actually did—on January 6?

All of Biden’s experts have said up to now that SVB and Signature Bank were isolated cases, caused by those institutions’ unique individual problems. So why is another bank now crashing? And didn’t Biden say he would put measures in place to stabilize the banking sector? Whatever he’s doing, it sure doesn’t seem to be working very well, as more banks are crashing less than a month after the initial crashes which prompted the Biden administration’s intervention. How does anyone trust Biden on the economy at this point? 
2023-04-26;https://www.axios.com/2023/04/26/biden-harris-2024, https://news.yahoo.com/kamala-harriss-approval-rating-falls-152326444.html;confidence;Harris’s approval rating has sunk to record lows, lower even than Cheney’s ratings, and with a 51% disapproval rating. Only the Democrats are able to put up such laughably inept candidates into office. Recall that Harris dropped out of the Democratic Party primary for president in 2020 before she even received a single vote. How unlikable do you have to be to quit your campaign before receiving even one vote? Harris’s unfavorability rating is even higher than Pence’s was, despite him being a highly polarizing figure. Yet for the Democrats, it’s not about whether anyone likes or has confidence in their candidates. The only thing that matters is whether a candidate will bow to the whims of the party elders. The Democrats care more about ramming through their agenda than fulfilling the wishes of the voters. Few primary voters would have chosen Harris as vice presidential candidate, had such a vote been held, yet she was chosen anyway. In order to get Biden (which for some reason the Democrats’ voters desperately wanted), they had to accept Harris. So if voters on any part of the political spectrum have any faith in her, it’s curious why she was chosen. What could the reason possibly be? 
2023-04-26;https://nypost.com/2023/04/26/biden-cheat-sheet-shows-he-had-advance-knowledge-of-journalists-question/;corruption;Biden was caught with a cheatsheet informing him of the questions he would receive from the press ahead of time. This just proves that the Democrats and the press are in collusion. The press is supposed to be adversarial to those in power, which would mean not informing those being interviewed of the questions they will be asked in advance. Instead, the press is subservient to the Democrats, giving them advance warning of the questions to be asked so an airbrushed response can be crafted and practiced. So we have a culturally dominant party that gets most of the media to bow before them, and has technical elite allies to carry out their censorship of dissenting views. How is this not the same as in Soviet Russia or Communist China?

Compared to what the Tennessee legislature did, this is extremely generous, as she is not expelled and not prohibited from voting. Just like all leftists, Zephyr has shown that she will throw a tantrum and make comments that our out of line when she doesn’t get her way. That is an affront to the democratic process, and disrespects the chosen representatives of other districts. She responds by riling up her supporters to bring the people’s business to a halt, and then has the audacity to claim that her opponents are the ones who are anti-democracy. The Iron Law of Woke Projection manifests itself again. No one is saying she cannot hold the views she does, or advocate for them on the House floor. All her colleagues are insisting on is that she do so respectfully. Explain, Democrats, how fellow party members like Zephyr are the ones who stand for democracy.

And isn’t it interesting that this increase in homicide just happens to coincide with Democrats scaling back or eliminating their police forces? The Democrats deny that they are soft on crime, but how do they back up their stance in light of data like this? How much longer are people willing to put up with this?

2023-04-28;https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-says-some-companies-cheat-h-1b-lottery-driving-record-applications-1a3e4fd;immigration;US companies are abusing the H1-B visa system to try and hire more immigrants. The real question that begs asking, but which the left stubbornly resists asking, is “why?”. It is one thing for companies to take advantage of a federal program which already exists, so that they can open their hiring to the widest pool of people (i.e. not limiting it to those in the US already, but those residing nearly anywhere who are willing to immigrate). But what incentive do they have to break the law to widen the scope of the H1-B program? True, it provides even more candidates, but they risk legal action from the US government in the form of hefty fines. But what if these companies reasonably suspected that the government wouldn’t prosecute them too aggressively for abusing the program? More importantly, why are companies willing to break the law rather than consider more US-based candidates (not even strictly US citizens, but citizens and visa/green card holders already on US soil)? It likely has something to do with their aggressive pursuit of “diversity” programs. Most Americans are white, whereas most humans around the world are not. Expanding the segment of foreigners they can hire means companies have an easier time pursuing their “diversity” programs… which are, themselves, also illegal because they use a protected class (race) as a factor in hiring. And again, the Democrat-controlled government doesn’t seem too interested in prosecuting this illegally racist hiring practice because Biden himself has sung the praises of “diversity” hiring and practices it at every turn. 
2023-04-29;https://www.axios.com/2023/04/29/first-republic-fdic-jpm-takeover;corruption;J. P. Morgan, which has already profited 52% since the banking crisis kicked off by SVB started, is now angling to buy First Republic Bank, which is crumbling directly due to the Biden administration’s cavalier handling of the current banking sector instability. Biden’s FDIC made it clear that it will cover anyone who wants to pull their money from banks, with the stated aim being to reduce bank runs. But if you essentially say “if you run on this bank, your money will definitely be there no matter how much you deposited”, then how does that NOT encourage bank runs? This essentially enables depositors with large accounts to yank out all their money and be sure they’ll have it all... and then redeposit it in the account of a big bank. In other words, it allows large depositors to collapse mid-sized banks: before this FDIC policy change, large depositors risked losing their money if their total withdrawal triggered a run. Now they can all leave at once and be sure they get all their money. This all ONLY works to the benefit of large banks like J. P. Morgan... whose CEO Dimon is on great terms with Obama (and probably Biden). Isn’t it interesting how the Democrats, who are cozy with the biggest banks in America, are implementing policies which shower money and market dominance on those same biggest banks in America? Explain, Democrats, how Republicans are the corrupt ones? The Republicans are, of course, also corrupt, but the Democrats’ corruption is the likes of which Republicans can only dream of. The GOP wishes they were so popular with wealthy Americans (as the Democrats are) that they could pull this kind of corruption, but alas, the Democrats’ culture war strategy has made the Republicans pariahs to most of the nation’s elites. Explain, Democrats, how this helps the poor? Explain, Democrats, how this helps racial minorities?
