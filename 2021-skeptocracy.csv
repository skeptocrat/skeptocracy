Two Politico reporters expressed concern that Janet Yellen, who was nominated as the Treasury Secretary, would not adequately regulate Wall Street in her presumptive role because she was paid large speaking fees by Wall Street firms. These reporters were then tarred as being sexist when their critiques had nothing to do with her identity as a female, but were purely based on her behavior. 
2021-01-02;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1345451667639197696;Democrats drop their charge that Trump is a fascist once the danger has passed, showing how hollow it always was. Despite appearing to praise fascism, Trump’s policies never resulted in any measurably fascistic outcomes. The entire “#resistance” against Trump was predicated on his being a fascist, but this argument fell apart when he signaled he would peacefully step down on inauguration day. But Democrats never acknowledged the hyperbole of their argument, and instead insist that the truly ominous fascism is yet to come. This also has the effect, as will be seen in Democrat reactions to future developments, of providing the pretext of an ominous, omnipresent, and vague threat on which to base future power grabs.

2021-01-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1347296818623873025;Democrats enlist their friends in Silicon Valley to censor their political opponents. In late 2020, a congressional committee controlled by Democrats concluded that tech monopolies wield a dangerous degree of power over how citizens can conduct themselves in certain segments of society. But literally the day after the January 6 riot in the Capitol Building, Democrats publicly called on these dangerously powerful tech monopolies to censor the opponents they deemed responsible for the riot.
2021-01-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1347336045545877505;Democrat-aligned media has taken it upon itself to sidestep the justice system and deputize its readers to find and punish political opponent rioters. The USA Today asked its readers to help scan photos for neighbors or other individuals they recognize to report them to the paper, despite the fact that crowdsourced justice has proven dangerously flawed (such as when Reddit users misidentified the Boston Marathon Bombers and implicated an innocent person). It also shows that Democrats are perfectly willing to use extralegal means to destroy their political opponents, rather than wait for law enforcement to sanction the help of civilians.
2021-01-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1347542922871377922;Democrats and their supporters voice blind endorsement to dramatic expansions of the security state to combat a threat that could have been mitigated with advanced preparation. The January 6 would have only required more police officers and more crowd control equipment to avoid, not vast expansions of the surveillance state. But because Democrats see a chance to grant their incoming administration immense new powers, they are willing to harness the fear among their base and independents to secure those powers.
2021-01-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1347747037719261184;The ACLU is so overrun with Democratic political operatives that it can’t bring itself to unequivocally oppose censorship when it targets Trump. After Twitter moved to suspend Trump’s account after the January 6 riots, the ACLU released a tortured, muddled statement in which they gave the most meager lip service to free speech, but then paid obligatory deference to Woke identity groups before requesting that social media apply their speech policies with “transparency.” It comes off as the most vacuous defense of free speech and a free pass to censor in service of select, “just” causes. 
2021-01-09;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1347898774891491332;Within days of the Capitol Riot, follower counts for prominent conservative accounts started plummeting. This suggests some combination of Republican supporters getting their accounts banned en masse and these supporters distancing themselves from the accounts in public spaces to avoid the same. There is so much social pressure to impose negative social consequences for mere patronage to moderately conservative voices that many are going into hiding, withdrawing public signs of support. This social media activity seems, from later developments, to be the opening salvo in a mass purge of conservative content from mainstream social media platforms. 
2021-01-10;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348244982730285061;Astute and principled political commentators are identifying the frenzy of tech oligopoly social media censorship at the behest of Democrats as an alarming fusion of public and private coercive power. As documented earlier Silicon Valley so overwhelmingly backs the Democrats that they are willing to destroy Democrats’ political enemies to stay in the latter’s good graces, especially if the alternative is onerous regulation.

Woke apologists insist that rejecting corporate censorship of all center-rightward voices, even on the grounds that it sets a dangerous precedent in civil discourse, enables fascism. But this, as the commentator points out, is the exact same “with us or against us” rhetoric that the left was wise to criticize under George W. Bush—rhetoric he used to justify his own dramatic security state apparatus expansion. 
2021-01-11;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1348619731734028293;Despite the fact that a negligible amount of the Capitol Riot planning took place on “alt-right social media platform” Parler, it received most of the blame. Most of the rioters’ organizing was conducted on Facebook, and much of its messaging took place on YouTube, yet neither of these platforms are facing any serious pressure to shut down (pressure Parler received), much less submit to tighter regulation. The reason is clear: the owners of these more-consequential but less-maligned social media platforms are powerful friends of the Democrats, and ones whose cooperation the Democrats will require to silence their political enemies. Google’s role in the effective destruction of Parler is particularly duplicitous: they own Parler’s competitor and site of significantly more right-wing organizing, YouTube. But instead of owning up to their role, Google effectively scapegoated Parler and went so far as to wield its control over the Google Play Store to (for all practical purposes) deny Android users the ability to install Parler.

According to a poll in which viewers of each outlet were asked to self-identify their political affiliation, around 9 in 10 news consumers of the New York Times and NPR indicated they were Democrats, and roughly the same proportion of Fox News viewers said they were Republicans. CNN was only slightly less ideologically left-leaning, with only 8 in 10 viewers identifying as Democrats. Thus, the notion that it’s only Fox News on the right and MSNBC on the left that are rabidly partisan is false, by media consumers’ own admission.

In their fight against Trumpist Republicans, Democrats are joining with hawk moderate Republicans like ex-Cheney staffers. And they are advocating such unconstitutional madness as denying members of one political party (the Republicans) from speaking unless their words conform to the “truth” as determined by the other (the Democrats). Such sentiment all but calls for a one-party state.

Wall Street firms don’t spend exorbitant amounts of money for trite speeches to glean wisdom from them, but to essentially buy the politician for the influence they can bring to bear on their colleagues currently in high office. Yellen is one such politician, and the Democrats have a particularly cozy relationship with Wall Street that they can be the primary beneficiaries of Wall Street’s munificence.

They would rather do this to make themselves seem like the perpetual victims—just as with Woke culture more broadly, thus justifying their bullying of others—than understand any possible reason one might have to enact violence against them (now, rather than in the many prior decades when this same level of threat could have materialized but didn’t).

First, it implies that all white people should be considered responsible for any negative outcome for non-white people. Second, it asserts, by inference, that racial prejudice and power dynamics should be reinforced, so long as it is done in at the cost of white people and to the benefit of non-white people. This directive to parents is to say nothing of what beliefs students are being indoctrinated with.

When Trump went golfing during the pandemic, Democrats accused him of negligence resulting in the deaths of thousands. But when Biden spent time idle by a fireplace and going to bed early, and playing video games with his family, he attracted no commensurate accusation of negligence. In fact, the reason we know about this is because media ran fluff pieces reporting on these activities in a positive, humanizing light rather than the critical one they leveled at Trump for the same behavior. 
2021-02-17;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1362054705271177230;When a black person is killed by police for any reason, the officer is immediately suspected of wrongdoing, but when a white person is killed by a police, the appropriateness of the action is isn’t even considered. Charges (figurative and literal) of police misconduct are leveled, and protests ensue, even when police officers kill armed black suspects. But when an unarmed and nonviolent woman was shot and killed point blank in the neck during the Capitol Riots, none of the prominent anti-police brutality or BLM voices came to her defense. The officer’s actions were never seriously called into question. This sends the message that white lives don’t matter, and police brutality is only a concern if the victims aren’t white.

In a letter to AT&T, Democrats on a House committee pointedly ask whether the company will continue to carry Fox News. As Greenwald subsequently notes in an article, the Supreme Court has ruled that the act of threatening government action against private entities if those entities don’t do what would be unconstitutional if done by the government is, itself, unconstitutional. Thus, by asking a cable provider to stop carrying Fox News under the implied threat of costly government regulation against cable providers, the Democrats are violating the First Amendment. But because this recent pressure on AT&T has yet to be challenged in court, if such moves become the norm, the Democrats will be able to wield the private sector to censor by proxy, under the cover of “free market” choices by private companies.

The notion that Greenwald, a gay man and committed progressive leftist, is bigoted against LGBT people is laughable. But because he dared to suggest that one’s social standing among progressives increases by claiming to be LGBT, he is accused of bigotry out of desperation by progressives to discredit his point.

The fact that former bigots are so readily accepted by a movement that, by its own tenets, should ostracize them proves that the Woke movement is not truly about racial justice, but about enacting retributive, mob justice on perceived wrongdoers.

In the current scale of technological and social development, “50 years” is a way of saying “forever” without explicitly saying so. Again, by invoking the pretext of fighting fake news, Democrat proxies in the media [see above regarding left-wing polarization of NPR] are trying to initiate a purge of opposing ideas.

When the Woke left trains its sights on someone, the mob is not held to any burdens of proof to prove the accusee’s transgressions, and the accusee enjoys no presumption of innocence, and no chance at rehabilitation. The accusee is simply ejected from social media, fired from their job, and expected to simply disappear.

There were 3 times as many stories about Trump in his first 100 days as president as there were about Biden in his first 100 days. This is not because Biden is a more scrupulous president with less abuses of power—the snippets of critical reporting on him suggest he is not—but because the media is functionally an extension of the Democratic party. 
2021-03-12;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1370488884786835457;Journalists and their supporters are labeling those who offer good faith criticism of their work as “violence” to delegitimize any questioning of their actions. As will be shown below, journalists for left-aligned media outlets have increasingly focused their reporting on denouncing ordinary people for not kowtowing to Woke edicts. Regardless, when a pro-left journalist’s work is criticized on its merits, the critique is written off as bigotry (e.g. racism, misogyny, etc.) against the journalist, and therefore as an act of violence. Equating speech with violence is an extremely disturbing trend: since it is commonly accepted that it is permissible to meet violence with violence, by making speech violence on an extremely subjective basis, this permits violent retaliation to speech. If one simply claims another’ speech is bigoted (according to Woke reasoning), the other’s speech is thus violent, and therefore one can then physically assault the other.

As Greenwald remarks, if a media outlet is truly committed to the truth and simply makes honest mistakes along the way, those mistakes should be evenly distributed between unfairly harming the political left and unfairly harming the political right. Yet the editorial history of the Washington Post, at least since 2016 if not a decade or more before, shows that their mistakes overwhelmingly come at the expense of the right.

Specifically, conditions detention facilities, including those for children, intended for temporary use are crowded with more detainees arriving everyday. Not only is it clearly not enough of a priority for Harris or Biden to promptly visit the border, but Harris laughs at the implied suggestion that she should be prioritizing it by being there now.

Literally the same liberals who advocated for defunding (or at least seriously reforming) the police are now contending that the police should be more violent with rioters who espouse political views they oppose. What liberals like this are asking for is literal state repression, carried out against those who dare to question their political orthodoxy. This is particularly galling considering that, for all that should be condemned about their actions, the Capitol Rioters were significantly less damaging to life and property than the George Floyd protests-turned-riots. So liberals think that the less destructive and violent riot should be met deadly force meted out by the state, but that the riots which destroyed way more property and injured and killed vastly more people, should be handled less aggressively. 
2021-03-28;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1376186734665474053;Academic conferences on the study of language are now almost wholly dedicated to re-engineering language to conform to Woke dictates. An attendee at a philosophy of language conference described some talks as “presenting on… propaganda.” The far-left is quite openly trying to edit out English any terms which could challenge their views, the first phase of which is to manufacture a consensus in the academic community. 
2021-04-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1377637874712055811;Media outlet self-avowedly committed to free speech declares that free speech should be forfeit when it gets in the way of serving, and pledging fealty to, the Woke agenda. Because of the close association in the constitution between free speech and free speech, journalists are intended to be the most devoted defenders of free speech. Today, however, journalists are using their reach and influence to advocate the forfeiture of free speech for partisan political ends (i.e. the Woke/progressive movement). 
2021-04-02;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1378007744440119296;In Vermont, if you are under 50 years old, non-white people get early access to vaccines while white people have to wait. Setting aside the priority given to older Vermonters and essential workers—who deservedly enjoy priority because of the increased risk that is causally linked to higher age and essential worker status—the policy for those who  are non-essential workers and under 50 is purely and nakedly based on race. This is a straightforward expression by the Vermont state government that they believe non-white people matter more than white people (instead of equally valuing all life). The state justified its prioritization of non-whites by citing lower vaccination rates for those groups, but this is a correlative and not a causal link: being non-white doesn’t biologically make you more susceptible to COVID. And the fact that non-whites are disproportionately employed as essential workers and essential workers are prioritized, race-based disparities are already being addressed by their actual causal relationships. As Greenwald points out, in underscoring the potential illegality of the policy, this is a glaring case of race-based discrimination.
2021-04-02;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1378110654662520834;Democrats theatrically play the “the Republicans are monsters” card when it suits them, but when members of their own party commit the same acts, they backpedal and claim that it’s not as bad as when the Republicans do it. Ocasio-Cortez took staged, melodramatic photos of herself weeping at border facilities in front of detained migrants to demonstrate the cruelty of US immigration policies, under Trump and Biden (as she, unlike mainstream Democrats, wants an open border). But when asked about Biden’s equally callous policies, she made the excuse that Biden isn’t as bad as Trump.

The Woke left believes that, because its cause if so noble, it is exempt from having to present evidence of its claims. And to enforce this privileged position in the discourse which it believes it deserves, the Woke left uses accusations of racism to delegitimize rational counter-arguments against them (or, really, just calls for high standards of evidence). What’s more, the fact that their response to a polite request for evidence is to make an ad hominem attack which they know will be extremely damaging to that person’s public image means they actually DON’T have the evidence to back up their claim. If they had the evidence, they would present it, so because they didn’t do that, they don’t.

Lee Fang, who is Asian-American and who writes for the left-wing Intercept, posted an interview asking this question, and he was tarred as a racist for doing so. The interview in question points out that 34 people were shot just in Chicago, just on Easter Sunday 2021, a number larger than the number of black people shot in Chicago in 1 year by police.

Interviews with Sicknick’s family and reviews of other documented material from the Capitol Riot have proven the narrative of Sicknick’s violent death at the hands of rioting Trump supporters to be utterly false. In spite of this, the lie was spread, and even read into the congressional record during the second Trump impeachment hearing. With this homicide narrative disproven, however, the truth is still conspicuously absent—it is extremely unlikely that after all this time DC medical examiners are still uncertain, but are withholding their conclusion for some reason. 
2021-04-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1380142578813829120;The Democrats have made more claims of election fraud than the Republicans since George W. Bush won the presidency in 2000. Democrats alleged election fraud in 2000 and 2004, which included claims that Diebold voting machines were untrustworthy (as the Republicans claimed in 2020). Democrats also claimed that the 2016 election was stolen because of Russian meddling—this includes beliefs by 2/3 of Democratic voters that Russia changed ballot counts in Trump’s favor. So the idea that Republicans uniquely doubt the integrity of elections is false—every loser, regardless of party, claims they lost because of cheating.

A user who posted sharply critical comments on Ocasio-Cortez was visited at their home by police officers. Ocasio-Cortez’s spokespeople indicated that the police did not look into the incident at her behest. However, assuming this is true, it is even more concerning: law enforcement is investigating, in a chilling manner, Americans’ First Amendment anti-Democrat speech of their own volition. 
2021-04-11;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1381280425117679618;A pro-Democrat lawyer implies that the very act of a Republican pursuing his own criminal defense proves his guilt, undermining the very concept of “innocent until proven guilty” and fair trials. The unspoken suggestion is that if an enemy of the Democratic party is alleged to have committed crimes—not even charged with said crimes but simply alleged to have committed them—they should be assumed to be guilty. To that end, this thinking holds up seeking the defense that one is constitutionally guaranteed as suspect. The whole point of the Fifth Amendment was to protect against the abuses by the British crown in which dissidents were simply pronounced guilty and imprisoned.

Large corporations are withdrawing from Georgia to deprive the state of tax revenue, spending (on such items as real estate, labor, infrastructure, etc.), and investment in retaliation for recent passage of their voter ID law. This sets the unsettling precedent in which large multinational corporations throw their weight around to pressure governments into acceding to police demands.

2020-08-10;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/8/10/us-chicago-sees-violence-looting-after-cop-involved-shooting;The left insists that the fact that looting and mass street violence follows major police shootings of black Americans does not undermine their movement at all. It has now become common for police shootings to be followed by people engaged in looting on the periphery of protest marches. If movements like BLM were really so morally righteous, why do they attract this kind of crime and violence? The reason is that progressive movements like BLM are tightly intertwined with other radical left political objectives like wealth redistribution: in the framing of left ideology, looting is just a spontaneous grassroots corrective to wealth inequality. It would be one thing if looting targeted only large chain retailers which can easily absorb the financial loss. But even small business owners, including those in poor racial minority communities, have been victims of looting in the wake of BLM protests. How does this help lift more racial minorities out of poverty?

Instead of being fair to all actors, assessing candidates based on their proficiency in the art of theater and not on their race, the journalist is advocating that race be factored into casting. In fact, the author makes the galling conclusion that it would be racist NOT to consider race in casting. Any rational person, and certainly civil rights leaders like Dr. King, would be appalled at this utterly backwards logic: that racism is avoided by judging people in part on their race. 
2020-08-20;https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/7kpq7z/facebook-is-treating-anti-fascism-the-same-as-murder-linked-conspiracy-groups;Left-wing news outlet Vice acts shocked that Facebook is censoring the pages Antifa, which is a violent left-wing terrorist street mob, the same way it censors other violent groups. By definition, Antifa is a terrorist organization: an entity which uses violence to secure desired political outcomes. Coverage of the true extent of Antifa’s activities is sparse in the overwhelmingly liberal sphere of US media, but they do not confine themselves to punching a few white supremacists at rallies. Antifa members have been arrested with explosives and firearms, and Antifa have beaten people to death. So there should actually be no surprise whatsoever that Facebook is treating them the say way it treats any and every group that glorifies violence. 
2020-08-27;https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/08/trump-and-gops-dark-warning-about-democrats/615763/;According to left journalists, when Republicans use analogies of armed struggle to frame their elections, it is ominous and authoritarian, but when Democrats do it, it is noble and justified. Both parties have always used the language of “fighting” for their cause, and since the Clinton administration, both parties have treated the election of their opponents as an apocalyptic outcome to be avoided at all costs. To insist that only Republicans couch their electoral language in these terms is dishonest, and imposes a double-standard that favors the Democrats.

In other words, they are worried that any scientific study or discipline which has the slightest chance of challenging the radical left orthodoxy will get shut down. If academics are worried there isn’t enough free thought or free speech to research, then the left radicalism on campuses is truly off the charts.

If the police are exacerbating the problem, as the left claims, how can they rationally (i.e. in a way that is logically consistent) argue that troops would help? The left’s point of view is that authorities with guns only make violence worse, and that if police are withdrawn and more city services like counseling are offered instead, violence will go down. So why aren’t they trying it? Do they not have faith in their own doctrine?

The radical left is just as violent—they are willing to kill their political opponents—as the radical right, but their violence simply garners significantly less attention. This is likely because the media is so biased toward the left (overall) that the media wants to insulate the left from accusations of violence. They want to advance the narrative that only the right is violent.

Journalists regularly use data that was obtained illegally to do their reporting, and when it is in the public interest they are right to do so. That doctrine clearly applies—people should know how Biden may have used his power as Vice President to enrich his family—but instead Twitter is picking and choosing who to apply their rule against “hacked data” to and, surprise, they only slap pro-right tweets with that rule.

If defunding the police actually worked, there was nothing stopping them from implementing exactly that policy.

When it comes to actually living by the moral tenets preached by their political ideology, left supporters flout it and serve their own selfish interests. Their moral stances are just empty gestures, and not something they actually act on when they have the chance. It shows precisely how empty the Woke movement is: they talk incessantly of doing the right thing for racial minorities and then take advantage of those very same groups as soon as they think they can get away with it.

This is yet another example of liberals virtue signaling one way and acting another: when it’s just talk, they say they care about workers, but when it comes to ensuring cheap transportation for themselves to enable their lifestyle, they vote in their own interests. Left voters openly demonstrate, with the dissonance between their words and their votes, that they stand for nothing and that all of their rhetoric is just cover to do as much self-serving behavior as they can get away with. 
2020-11-06;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/11/6/us-networks-pull-the-plug-on-trumps-live-address-due-to-lies;The partisan double-standard is such that when a Republican lies, the media takes it upon itself to censor that public official, but when a Democrat lies, they allow the unobstructed transmission of that public official’s lies. As has been repeatedly shown, there is no objective standard among the left and the media that serves its interests: they concoct rules for the supposed preservation of norms in society, but then only apply them to the right.

The fact that Maduro, a man who is starving his own people with his incompetence while continuing to live large, believes that Biden will be open to making concessions where Trump was not shows exactly what kind of leader the world expects Biden to be: one who can be pushed around and give way to the bullies of the world. 
2020-11-09;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/11/how-trump-grew-his-support-among-latinos/617033/;In spite of the left tarring Trump as a racist for four years, Trump GAINED Latino voters (in percentage and absolute terms) from 2016 to 2020. Are Democrats really about to imply that Latinos are too stupid to identify racism against them? How is THAT not the racist point of view to take? The more likely explanation is either that (a) Latinos don’t see Trump as a racist or (b) that Latinos don’t care if Trump is a racist because they perceive him as able to do a better job helping them and their families find prosperity. This identity politics lens through which Democrats see the world imposes this racial destiny on nonwhites—because of their skin color, they MUST vote a certain way—that is more racist than anything Trump has said.

It doesn’t matter to Democrats that real estate is the one thing Trump actually has some expertise on, or that neoclassical architecture is more structurally sound (from years of testing) than experimental modern architecture, or that neoclassical architecture is less expensive than experimental modern architecture, or that neoclassical architecture is more immediately recognizable as a government facility (and thus easier for citizens to find) than experimental modern architecture—in other words, that there is actual reasoning behind Trump’s memo.

When you prosecute a police officer every time they use force, even to stop violent perpetrators caught in the act, what would you expect them to do except decline to engage as many violent offenders or stop as many crimes? The incentive structure in an environment dictated by left-wing activists is clear: if you stop a violent crime, you run the risk of getting fired and thrown in prison, but if you let violent crime play out, you get to keep your paycheck. How would any rational person expect otherwise?
2020-12-29;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/12/29/biden-criticises-pace-of-trumps-covid-vaccine-rollout;Biden had the audacity to charge the Trump administration of moving too slowly (that it would “take years”) on vaccines despite the fact that (1) at the time the Trump administration was already moving fast and (2) the vaccines eventually (April 2021) got delivered exactly on schedule and within one year’s time. Democrats have demonstrated a pathological refusal to believe that Trump is capable of doing anything right. 
2020-12-31;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-year-end-gun-violence-20201231-33wbrdh44jbr7h5u77sunwj2pu-story.html;Experts posit exactly what any rational person could have told you, but which the left still denied: that looting and street violence on the periphery of BLM protests in the summer of 20202 (along with the pandemic) led to more homicides in Chicago. This fantasy that BLM protesters present, that killings will go down if we dismantle the police, is simply not true. It wasn’t true intuitively, and now it is proven to not be true empirically. They pose the false choice between police and more violence, and no police and less violence. But in effect, left-wing activists are trading police killings—even if we assume that they are 100% unjustified (which, of course, is not the case)—for street homicides. 
2021-01-06;https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217894/deplatform-trump-twitter-ban-facebook-youtube-congress-capitol-riots;A prominent online tech news publication actively called for the censorship of a sitting US president. Journalists should be the last people to call for censorship, since their profession depends on free speech, but the media is so desperate to please their Democrat allies that they are willing to advocate the censorship of Democrats’ political opponents. 
2021-01-07;https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218285/twitter-facebook-trump-coup;The same tech outlet singled out the Republican members of Congress who voted to investigate the outcome in the highly abnormal (at least insofar as the unprecedentedly high volume of mail-in voting is concerned) 2020 election, as if these duly elected representatives were traitors to be persecuted. It is pathetic, disgusting, and dangerous that a journalistic outlet would engage in this McCarthyite rabble-rousing. And of course, the Democrats have done this exact same thing in previous elections, such as when Democratic senators Dick Durbin, Chuck Schumer, and Hillary Clinton challenged the outcome of the 2004 election of George W. Bush, but faced no accusations of treason or anti-democratic aims. We find yet another pro-left double standard: Democrats are allowed to challenge elections (which they also essentially did in 2016), but not Republicans. 
2020-01-07;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/7/leaders-activists-blast-double-standard-in-police-response;After a summer of demanding less police brutality against protesters, when DC police supposedly (to the Democrats) utilized less aggressive tactics on the Capitol rioters, Democrats cried foul. Insofar as DC police were less aggressive (true in some respects) it was not because the protesters they were policing were white: it was because the police were unprepared for the scale of the protest-turned-riot and did not have the numbers or crowd-control weapons to repel the rioters. If the DC police, in the numbers and equipment they possessed, had gotten violent with the rioters, it would have escalated to the point where it would have led to significantly more deaths among police and rioters. Police restraint was to prevent unnecessary loss of life. And, indeed, the rioters did little more than break some glass and shove some police (for which they should be duly prosecuted), so there was no reason to escalate the use of force: as the rioters were behaving on the whole, there was little risk to loss of life. However, the “kid gloves” narrative is not wholly true. Police did shoot and kill an unarmed rioter at point-blank range. This is way more violent than any policing of BLM protests in the summer of 2020. And yet the Democrats insist that the Capitol Rioters got lenient treatment. In light of the actual facts, this contention is absurd. 
2021-01-07;https://www.zdnet.com/article/twitter-should-immediately-and-permanently-ban-trump/;Yet another tech hews outlet calls for a sitting, duly elected US president to be censored.

2021-01-07;https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack;Social media companies immediately begin falling over themselves to censor a sitting president and prove they’re good, subservient little Democrat bootlickers. And, of course, they don’t even hesitate to turn around and say that they’re unbiased and that they apply their community standards policies even-handedly. This, of course, is sheer hypocrisy, as they will ban anything in connection with far-right groups like the Proud Boys but won’t ban Antifa, despite the fact that Antifa is more violent than almost any far-right analogue. 
2021-01-08;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/1/8/pelosi-spoke-to-us-general-about-blocking-trump-nuke-access;Democrats are so obsessed with thwarting Trump at every turn that they are willing to waste time impeaching a president who will have left office—in favor of their candidate assuming—by the time they can try him in the Senate than actually turn their attention to issues that impact the American people.

Since Facebook as the main platform for this planning, why didn’t Google and Apple ban Facebook from their app stores? The reason why is that this was a convenient pretext for Google to kneecap a rapidly rising competitor (with YouTube).

It’s far more likely that Democrats caught COVID from the Democrat with COVID whom they allowed into their chamber, not Republicans who weren’t masked. And of course, they’ve ruled out the chance that they contracted COVID by breaking pandemic public health laws, such as by going to a salon without a mask (as Pelosi did)—there’s no way, in their mind, that it could have been any other reason but that Republicans didn’t wear masks in their presence. But as so much evidence has made clear, Democrats will embrace any claim that makes them look virtuous and their opponents look depraved, even if it’s untrue, unfounded, or unlikely. 
2021-01-14;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/01/14/restaurants-bars-should-be-reopened-as-soon-as-possible-lightfoot-says/;Despite there being no evidence that the pandemic was any less rampant than days or weeks before—in fact, the holiday spike was still raging at the time—Democrats began moving to loosen pandemic restrictions. For a party that professes to deeply care about addressing the pandemic and “follow the science”, the Democrats sure don’t seem to make policy decisions based on any scientific evidence, opening up despite the pandemic not abating at that particular point in time. 
2021-01-20;https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/1/20/bbamazon-offers-to-help-biden-distribute-covid-19-vaccines;Amazon offers to help the Biden administration distribute vaccines but, of course, did not offer to help the Trump administration do so. This is more proof that Big Tech is firmly biased toward the Democrats, since they will go out of their way to make Democrats look good and Republicans look bad, even if that means delaying the shipment of life-saving vaccines. 
2021-01-28;https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/just-open-schools-already/617849/;After spending the entire pandemic up until Biden took office screaming that it was unsafe for Trump to push to open schools, suddenly the pro-Democrat media starts reporting that it’s safe to open schools. As has become obvious to any rational observer, to Democrats and their allies, anything Republicans do is bad, but anything Democrats do—even if it’s the same policy the Republicans proposed—is good.

How fanatical does a group have to be for it to condemn a figure who blazed the path that leads up to your supposed cause (“racial justice”)?
2021-02-20;https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-tech-employees-opened-wallets-for-biden-campaign-11613833201;A review of the data freely available from the FEC (as required by law) shows that “Big Tech” employees overwhelmingly donated to Biden over Trump, completely dispelling the left’s fiction that Big Tech holds a right-wing bias. This also explains why social media was so quick to censor Trump and anything that made Biden look bad (e.g. the New York Post story into using his Vice Presidential authority to enrich his family). This also previews other data that shows that the wealthy overwhelmingly support Biden, too.
2021-02-23;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/02/23/sanctuary-city-ordinance-signed-into-law-better-protecting-chicagos-immigrants-from-ice/;Chicago signs a “Sanctuary City” ordinance into law to shield illegal migrants from ICE even in the face of Biden’s assurance of mercy. If Biden promised not to aggressively send ICE after illegal migrants, why are cities fortifying preparing to harbor those that are fleeing ICE? It shows that Democrats—fellow party members with the most ready access to Biden’s actual policies—don’t actually believe Biden will ease off of immigration enforcement. Once again, it looks as though the Democrats lied to their voters, virtue signaling one way and acting the opposite.

In other words, they were unprepared, caught off guard, and so did not have the numbers or equipment on site at the time to execute any kind of effective crowd control. Contrast that with policing the BLM protests, which provided many days’ advance notice of the threat that would be faced. When you have days of advance warning, of course you can bring more numbers to bear on crowds.

In other words, Biden’s signal that illegal migration is easier under his administration likely attracted more migrants, and in response he has had to break all his campaign promises by being even more ruthless than Trump in terms of detaining families and children at the border.

How does it make any sense to allow people to mingle more and in larger groups when you just admitted that cases are rising? And yet the public official making these decisions is a member of the party whose unofficial motto is “we follow the science”. It sure doesn’t seem like they do.
2021-04-03;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56620113;Democrats continue to assert that Republicans are the authoritarians at the same time as they (the Democrats) move to maintain troops on the streets of the capital and assert that there are vague security threats that then never materialize. This is the favorite tactic of fascist dictators the world over: claim there’s always a threat lurking around the corner so that they can keep soldiers deployed to protect their regime. For nearly 4 years, Antifa pursued an agenda of destroying government buildings and the Trump administration STILL never put troops on the streets of DC.

In other words, vaccines and COVID infections correlate because the same group that got the most infections by partying now want vaccines so they can party without consequences. 
2021-04-12;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/12/chauvin-judge-refuses-jury-sequester-as-minneapolis-faces-unrest;The judge in the Chauvin case doesn’t care about a fair trial when Chauvin’s defense attorneys raised the possibility that a new police shooting of a black man might lead to left-wing activists, pundits, and politicians biasing the jury’s verdict. A judge committed to impartial justice, and who is confident in the jury reaching the correct verdict, would have granted the sequester so that the defense would have no leg to stand on to allege improprieties. Essentially, a jury sequester would have made the outcome irreproachable by taking pains to remove all perceptible sources of bias. Under those circumstances, a guilty verdict would have carried more weight, but now there will always be lingering questions. 
2021-04-13;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1382025043480346629;Companies make theatrical shows of Woke activism to distract leftists and Democrats from the real damage they do by corrupting the government. Large corporations have begun ingratiating themselves to the left by overtly endorsing left policies. But by welcoming and encouraging this behavior, the left is inviting corporations to worm their way deeper into the fabric of our republic. Once there, they can exercise new levels of control. For instance, the economic boycotting of states whose government enact laws they oppose is setting the stage for these corporations to throw their weight around and threaten economic strangulation if their demands aren’t met. These publicity stunts also have the effect of drawing fire away form labor violations, environmental degradation, and the continued regime of corporate welfare that they have established at the federal level on down. By making these showy virtue signaling gestures, these companies are duping the left into forgetting their real professed mission: combating wealth inequality and classism. 
2021-04-14;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1382332669682458629;Democrat-proxy media invents an absurd new victimized group to skewer a Republican for victimizing. In the smears against Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, who at the time of this tweet was under investigation for—but not charged with nor faced with evidence of—a number of sex crimes including soliciting sex from a prostitute and having sex with a minor. In order to paint Gaetz as even worse, media started referring to 18- and 19-year-old women he supposedly slept with as “former minor[s].” There is literally nothing objectionable, in the eyes of the law, that bars an adult from having sex with another adult if both parties consent. This is particularly absurd because all adults are, by definition, “former minors.” So by creating this arbitrary category, left-allied media can smear anyone for something that the law—and liberal Western society, for that matter—does not regard as wrong.

2021-04-15;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/15/taiwan-says-chinas-activities-threaten-regional-stability;Taiwan has assessed China to be a growing threat to regional peace, vindicating their worry that China would be more confrontational under Biden than Trump. Again, China would not inch closer to war if they thought Biden would realistically impede them, so the fact that China is doing so suggests that they don’t see Biden as being willing or able to stop it. 
2021-04-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1382714557941100548;The US intelligence community admitted that its prior assessment that Russia was offering bounties on US troops in Afghanistan, an assessment that US media picked up and ran with under the assumption that it was true, was likely false. The media used this as a cudgel against Trump, accusing him of inaction in the face of what would have been a brazen act by the Russian government… if it were true. The reason why the erroneous story ran in the first place was (1) it reflected badly on Trump and (2) the media trusted an unsupported assertion by the intelligence community without doing any corroboration (which, as journalists, is their job). But, as this and numerous previous citations in this document point out, journalistic malpractice is now seen as permissible if it is used against the Republican party.

2021-04-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1382732746284498946;While Twitter and other social networks have been quick to brand false claims by Republicans and their proxies as “disinformation,” they are showing not even the slightest impulse to apply the same label to media outlet posts falsely claiming that Russia offered bounties on US troops.  By the actions of Twitter and other social networks, it is clear that the standards of information accuracy do not apply to Democrats and their proxies. As the overwhelming number of past incidents show, only the right can be guilty of spreading disinformation. 
2021-04-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1382791446554673160;In the eyes of pro-Democrat media, when a Republican is suspected of wrongdoing, their Republican colleagues are automatically guilty by association, with no need for evidence. Pro-Democrat media makes an unfounded claim that, because associates of Republican Governor of Florida Ron DeSantis are under investigation for sex crimes, that he is likely guilty of similar crimes as well. In the eyes of the law, one’s guilt is determined in court, with each individual tried singly and with specific evidence of wrongdoing presented. But in the media, merely knowing one who is just suspected of wrongdoing is enough to tarnish one’s reputation and insinuate similar wrongdoing. Again, this guilt by association principle seems to only apply to Republicans. Associates of Al Franken and Katie Hill did not have their reputations attacked, nor should they have.

This development would, rightly, discredit the ends and means of the BLM movement. So, because Facebook wants to please the Democrats who have already used their positions in the House to threaten regulation if social media doesn’t censor Democrats’ opponents, Facebook is proactive in targeting anyone and anything that obstructs Democrats’ political objectives.

2021-04-18;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1383785161033076743;Dr. Fauci, who gained significant publicity while working as a public health bureaucrat under Trump, dismissed concerns over the civil liberties impacts of pandemic public health controls as essentially absurd. Despite the very clear tension between the proposed public health measures imposed on US citizens and rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, Fauci brushes these concerns aside as irrelevant. This is not only disingenuous, but sets a dangerous precedent in which government officials who hold influence in the public discourse condition the public to disregard the erosion of civil liberties in the face of a sufficiently terrifying crisis. 
2021-04-19;https://twitter.com/SteveGuest/status/1384123097201004550;The media cast considerable doubt that Trump could never set up a vaccine delivery program that would distribute vaccines to all Americans by April 2021, but now that Biden is following through to make good on that promise, the media is marking this development with little fanfare (and DEFINITELY no credit to Trump).

2021-04-19;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1384213421214765062;A journalist whose role is to serve as a “senior legal analyst” openly scoffed at the idea that the defense for George Floyd’s killer, Derek Chauvin, would underscore the legal definition of “reasonable doubt” and, thus, the jury’s legal duty. The journalist, whose job it is to understand the finer points of the law, strongly implied that it was audacious that a criminal defense attorney remind jurors of the definition of “reasonable doubt,” to which their verdict legally must conform. This comment, and the many others like it that are sure to be circulating on social media (by those both more and less supposedly credible than this CNN journalist) erode the very idea of a fair trial, suggesting that the government–on the public’s behalf—should be able to simply pronounce guilt. This is such an unsettlingly perilous sentiment that the Founders literally enshrined the right to a fair trial in the constitution. 
2021-04-19;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1384235113156775943;The autopsy for the police officer who died during the Capitol Riot was finally released, revealing that the story circulated widely in the media that he was beaten to death by Trump supporters was a complete lie. The autopsy revealed that officer Brian Sicknick died of two strokes which he suffered on the day of the riot, and that his body showed no indication of blunt force trauma at all, or even of inhalation of tear gas chemicals. This is yet more evidence that the pro-Democrat media is willing to run with any story, no matter how scant the evidence, as long as it reflects badly on Trump and the Republicans. This lie was spread so widely that it was cited in Trump’s second impeachment hearing as evidence of his malfeasance, and was repeated by Biden who so many in the media class praise as always speaking the truth.
2021-04-20;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/20/maxine-waters-urges-confrontation-if-chauvin-found-not-guilty;A Democrat implored a group of allied activists to initiate a “confrontation” with Chauvin if he was not convicted in the killing of George Floyd, something which the Democrats condemned as incitement when Trump did it. Once again, the Democrats hold their opponents to standards they never hold themselves to. When Trump tells supporters to go to the Capitol, he is accused of inciting an “insurrection”, but when a House Democrat tells supporters to angrily surround someone, there is no accusation of incitement or fomenting violence.

The previous summer’s riots were enough to suggest this possibility. If the Woke activists didn’t want Lightfoot to prepare the National Guard for a riot, they should do more to ensure that their protests don’t turn into riots. There’s a double-standard here, too: the left holds all attendees at the Capitol on January 6 responsible for the riot even though only a small subset of them rioted, yet the left feels BLM activists shouldn’t be blamed when the periphery of BLM protesters star rioting, 
2021-04-21;https://twitter.com/andraydomise/status/1384897580946046979;Activists railed against Trump as the greatest harm to racial minorities in a generation, only to find out that Biden’s policies are materially worse for racial minorities than Trump’s. Everyone on the left lost condemned Trump as a racist for making inflammatory remarks (which they took out of context or misread to perceive as racist), and yet they found nothing racist or harmful to racial equality in electing Biden, a man who is most culpable single individual for the imprisonment of black people since desegregation. His crime bill in the 1990s put more black people in jail and more severely eroded black communities than anything Trump did (ever). But then the people most concerned about racial justice as surprised when, only months in office, Biden enacts policies that continue to flout their moral worldview. In other words, Democrat voters had every reason to suspect that they would get what they got, and they voted for him anyway. This means that they are either stupid or so callous that they don’t care.
2021-04-22;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/4/22/us-house-votes-to-make-washington-dc-the-51st-state;After only hanging onto both houses of Congress by the barest margins, Democrats are suddenly very concerned that Washington, DC become a state despite never emphasizing this in any of their 2020 campaigning. They’re acting like the Founders never considered the possibility of DC having statehood, like it was an glaring and unjust oversight instead of an intentional design to make DC neutral among the states and fully under federal control (for security). The Democrats aren’t interested in justice or setting right past wrongs, but getting 2 more senators and 1 more House member from a state which would be perma-Democrat. And yet Democrats have the audacity to accuse Republicans of being shamelessly partisan (e.g. refusing to vote on Garland’s Supreme Court nomination in 2016). 
2021-04-22;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1385214276776964101;A writer for a left-wing media snidely referred to Glenn Greenwald, a committed leftist and an even more committed civil libertarian, as a “Fox contributor” to slanderously discredit him in the eyes of the left. Because the left automatically dismisses any and all products of Fox’s reporting as false, aligning Greenwald with Fox will discredit him. A left-winger is willing to outright and transparently lie to try to sabotage the credibility of someone who is bringing reason-based criticism to the current dominant leftist movement (social justice/Critical Race Theory/Wokeness). 
2021-04-22;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1385222747706511363;The mere allegations of sexual misconduct are now viewed (by the left) as sufficient pretext to boycott and encourage companies to stop doing business with prominent public figures, but this does not apply if you are a Democrat politician. Authors accused of—not charged with or convicted of—sexual assault are having their publishers cease distribution of their books. But not only has Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo been accused of allegations, but he was also revealed to have released fraudulent COVID infection numbers in his state and used state resources to prioritize his family for COVID-related care, and he has still not stepped down, nor been pressured in any serious way by his own party to do so. Clearly, Democrats beloved by their party establishment are exempt from rules that would result in the financial and/or reputational ruin of any other person. 
2021-04-23;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1385571457317625857;Journalists are pushing for social media to carry out more censorship by claiming that NOT censoring content is a threat to democracy. This is so surreally unsettling for many reasons. First, journalists should literally be the last people to call for censorship, if only out of self-preservation instinct: if they encourage a precedent of censorship by unaccountable tech companies, they leave themselves at the mercy of the same tech companies of being censored, themselves. In fact, journalism is only able to be as adversarial as it needs to be to expose corruption and wrongdoing by the most powerful entities in society BECAUSE there is no censorship. But on top of that this new alarming (and profoundly ironic) trend, the idea that censorship is democratic by any kind of twisted logic is literally Orwellian: Orwellian a la “War is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength.”

The situation was fraught and tragic, but the police officer did what they were sworn to do: protect innocent life, making split-second decisions that result in the death of violent perpetrators if necessary to that end. However, the left is so hell-bent on painting every police shooting as unjust that they are making “demented” arguments that the officer should have stood by and watched a violent crime occur without intervening in the only way that would have realistically been effective at that juncture. They are literally advocating for letting violence play out against innocent people over the police using deadly force. Some notes on the incident in question: The police officer drove up to a scene of active violence between several people, and began by exiting his patrol car and pointedly exclaiming “What’s going on here?” (implying not only the literal semantics of his question but also the connotation of an imperative order to stop). The violence did not deescalate, so the officer drew his service weapon. He then witnessed a girl brandish a knife at another girl whose back was to a solid object (and so unable to easily escape) and then begin to plunge the knife toward the latter girl. The officer responded by firing a shot at the assailant. Again, tragic as any situation is when the life of one person must be weighed against that of another, in this incident the officer did what he was trained to do, and what his oath and the law demanded that he do.;;2021-04-23;https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1385354583904509952;A journalist (with a considerably more objective view than the vast majority of his colleagues) breaks down the immense volume of dishonest rhetoric by the left to justify their calls for the officer in the Ohio shooting of Ma’Khia Bryant (above) to face “accountability.” His analysis is thorough, too much so to get into detail here. Suffice it to say, though, that he exposes all of the false claims (e.g. that Bryant, the assailant clearly caught on body camera footage with a knife, was unarmed), and unfair comparisons (e.g. that it wasn’t fair that Kyle Rittenhouse, the shooter at a Kenosha protest who was apprehended while encountered NOT in the immediate act of killing someone, was not killed by police but that Bryant, who was encountered in the imminent act of attempted homicide, was killed) made to turn Bryant into a BLM martyr and exact vengeance against her killer, the police officer doing his job. ;;2021-04-23;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1385673238882275330;When press secretaries for Democrats try to ingratiate themselves in a questionably ethical way to journalists who are supposed to be professionally critical and skeptical of them, it is portrayed as a kind-hearted and endearing gesture. As Greenwald aptly points out, had Trump’s press secretary done this, he or she would have been condemned as trying to manipulate the press, not unfairly had that been the case—no politician or their proxy should be essentially bribing the press for implicit better treatment. ;;2021-04-23;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1385720438391721984;Schools are literally segregating their communities by race and calling it racial justice. A school district, in its message to parents, had one meeting link reserved for only parents who are racial minorities (anyone who is not white), while there was a separate meeting link—a separate meeting—for white parents. This is more proof that anti-racism is exactly the opposite of what it claims to be. Treating people differently based on their race is the exact and literal definition of racism. ;;2021-04-24;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1385946754823168002;Fact-checking itself has now been politicized, and because of the left-wing political polarization of the media, this politicization consistently benefits the left. When it was announced that Senator Tim Scott, a black Republican was chosen to give a rebuttal speech to Biden’s speech before congress, the Washington Post conducted a fact-check on his life story, as if a “real” black person whose forebears worked in cotton fields could never possibly become a Republican. As Greenwald incisively points out, if the media had subjected a black Democrat to the same level of scrutiny and skepticism over their background as they did to Scott, the left would cry racism. ;;2021-04-25;https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1386391617167183872;Leftists are trying to convince everyone that the media always took COVID seriously, and that it’s just Republicans that don’t, when the record shows that the media early on dismissed it as insignificant. Influential media outlets brushed off the precautions that some Americans took in early 2020 as paranoid. But now that the left wants to deride the right and paint all Republicans as COVID deniers, the left is trying to pretend that their media allies never took COVID less than gravely seriously. As the Twitter commentator noted, the “wokes” are trying to “rewrite history” on who believed that COVID was a serious threat and who didn’t, to make it look like Democrats were all responsible and prescient when they were just as blindsided by COVID escaping China as everyone else.;;2021-04-26;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1386807655252045825;In order to fight “racially motivated violent extremists” (which the left has insistently referred to as “domestic terrorists”), the FBI has searched data obtained via NSA spying without a warrant. The NSA, by its charter, is not supposed to be utilized in any way to spy on Americans. In querying data from the NSA on Americans without a warrant, the FBI has not only abetted the NSA in violating the spirit (if not the letter) of its charter, but it has also potentially violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and the Fourth Amendment. This overzealousness, and willingness to break the law, by the FBI is due to the left’s demand that domestic terrorism be elevated to the highest law enforcement priority. In its obsession with domestic extremism—with the primary ends being painting themselves as the victims—the left will clearly allow any perversion of the rule of law and any dangerous precedent of privacy and due process violation, as long as the “terrorists” are stopped. ;;2021-04-26;https://twitter.com/kittypurrzog/status/1386701506934501381;As Herzog astutely points out, if the Trump administration had hoarded vaccines (with what is, I’m sure, the same strategic purpose for which Biden’s administration is doing so), the leftists and their media allies would have cried bloody murder. But when Democrats do it, there is no criticism leveled against Biden whatsoever. ;;2021-04-27;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1387017183276982273;When Rose McGowan’s revelation of widespread sexual assault in the film industry reinvigorated the feminist movement, she was heralded as a hero on the left, but as soon as she accused the Democrats of behaving like a cult, she became persona non grata among the left and derided as a traitor to the cause. Her observation, founded on her experience growing up in a cult, was that while the Republicans outwardly own up to their beliefs (however objectionable), the Democrats pretend to serve the average American and then line their pockets behind everyone’s backs. But pointing this out is so intolerable to Democrats that they were willing to tear down their #MeToo savior. ;;2021-04-28;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1387400658714779654;Democrats assert, with no evidence, that increasingly visible (i.e. more widely reported by the media) incidents of violence against Asians is due to white supremacist racism, yet evidence comes out contradicting this claim. When an elderly Asian man was attacked in New York City (shortly after the shooting in Atlanta that killed mostly female Asian victims), the left was quick to insist that it was more evidence of white supremacist racism BEFORE the perpetrator’s identity was even known. Yet now that the alleged perpetrator has been arrested, and this individual turns out to not be white but black, no great number of leftists who made the unsubstantiated claims of anti-Asian hate is retracting their claim or finding alternative evidence. ;;2021-04-28;https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1387514072078471169;In a case deciding whether a student speaking critically and irreverently about his school on social media is protected under the First Amendment (or whether they can be made to face school disciplinary action), while the Supreme Court sided underscored the student’s First Amendment rights, Biden did not. This case is illustrative, in miniature, of the contempt that Democrats quite evidently have for the First Amendment when it used to criticize authority. In academic, media, and cultural circles, Democrat allies are firmly dominant, as are Democrat politicians in almost all major population centers. Additionally, Democrats currently control two of three branches of the federal government. Viewed in this light, Democrats largely are the authority that dissenters are only able to criticize by appealing to the First Amendment. They have betrayed their commitment to the First Amendment because it is the last bastion in which their opponents may hide. And while they make a point not to say this openly in such explicit terms, their views emerge when confined to more narrow cases like this student.;;2021-04-28;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1387559932812308489;In his remarks to Congress tonight, Biden stated that the Capitol Riot on January 6, 2021, in which rioters committed only minor property damage and no homicides, was the worst attack on the nation since the Civil War. This is not only a baldfaced lie, but it is patronizing and dangerous. 9/11, Pearl Harbor, and a host of more deadly attacks constituted far more grave attacks on the US than the acts o the aggressive, felonious, but non-homicidal rioters on January 6. In fact, not only did the rioters not kill anyone but, contrarily, only rioters died, including one who was slain at point-blank range by the state. This remark is not simply an honest inaccuracy, but a deliberate attempt to paint opposition to the Democrats as an existential threat to the country, and therefore a legitimate pretext for more security state powers and reprisals.;;2021-04-29;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/04/29/chicago-loosening-coronavirus-rules-as-cases-drop-vaccinations-climb-all-right-chicago-lets-reopen/;Democrat-controlled jurisdictions are acting as though, in only 3 months, Biden radically brought COVID under control where Trump didn’t, and rapidly ending all their restrictions. Vaccination rates at this point are not very high, and case rights are not much lower than in January, but Democrats are acting like COVID is on its last legs. This is circumstantial evidence to the idea that the Democrats crashed their economies via hard lockdowns wherever they were in power, to crush the economy and make Trump look bad, only to open up the economy once their party was back in power. ;;2021-04-29;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1387745169617920006;The day after Senator Tim Scott gave the Republican rebuttal to Biden, in which he stated that “America is not a racist country” and that Democrats act more interested in decrying everything as racist than actually acting to address this supposedly pervasive evil, the racist hashtag “Uncle Tim” trended on Twitter with very little condemnation from the left. Although it is not easy to ascertain with certainty the political alignment of those disseminating this hashtag, it would seem unlikely that Republican voters are so overwhelmingly racist that they would hurl a racist epithet at a member of their own party who consistently advocated for policies that they support. It is much more likely that these racist remarks are emanating from Democrat supporters, who feel threatened by a black man with the courage to call out the Democrat’s disingenuous and fabricated commitment to “racial justice” and the fictions they concoct to support their efforts. Regardless of the political orientation that most of the hashtag’s participants subscribe to, the left can still squarely be branded as hypocrites for availing themselves of every other opportunity to denounce racism… only to be (in the main) silent when the victim is a Republican. A “racial justice” that only fights for justice’s enjoyment by one partisan camp is no justice but, truly, an injustice. ;;2021-04-29;https://twitter.com/TJHoonhout/status/1387760934840586250;The fact that Twitter even allowed the racist “Uncle Tim” hashtag to be featured in its “Trending” sidebar—and, thus, circulate more widely—is a violation of its own community standards against racism, proving by its actions that content moderation to protect against racism is, in practice, only for Democrats. It would be one thing if Twitter and other social media applied its standards uniformly. But the reality is that, when actual undeniable racism harms Democrats, social media platforms take swift and aggressive action. But when the victim is a Republican, moderation action is delayed, if it happens at all. This shows, clear as day, how transparently self-serving and hypocritical the left’s commitment to racial justice is. All the histrionic displays of outrage are just bullying tactics to push the Democrat agenda, not actually condemn hateful speech or promote justice. ;;2021-04-30;https://twitter.com/MZHemingway/status/1387821505627803657;The media are fawning over Biden in a way that they NEVER would for a Republican president, and in a way that flies brazenly in the face of what journalism should be doing: being critical of, and not deferential to, those in power. This isn’t to say that the media can never make flattering observations about a government official. But their job is not to disseminate fluff humanizing PR pieces for those officials free of charge, as they have so clearly and shamelessly done here. ;;2021-04-30;https://www.engadget.com/riot-valorant-voice-chat-record-toxicity-181441193.html;The left is so anxious to censor all speech that they disapprove of that they are enacting surveillance regimes wherever they have the power to do so, with even video game companies recording all their users’ voice chats under the pretext of stopping “harassment”. History has amply shown that when given surveillance authority of this kind, one always abuses it. Recording conversations means someone will inevitably listen to them in overreach of their authority. But this doesn’t matter to the cultural left: what matters is the control this will grant them.;;2021-04-30;https://twitter.com/i/status/1388115216693616641;The left pitched a fit when a Fox News host, in an obviously hyperbolic and insincere manner, told viewers to call child protective services on parents who make their children wear masks, and the facts bore out that no ostensible viewers of the host’s program took this literally. This is classic psychological projection: the fact that Democrat supporters believed the media lie that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia, or that Russia ordered bounties on US troops, or countless other unfounded claims proves that the left are the ones who don’t think critically and trust implicitly whatever their preferred media outlets tell them. When a reporter contacted child protective service agencies in multiple states to determine if there was a spike in calls that correlated to the Fox host’s show, they all said that there was not. ;;2021-04-30;https://twitter.com/allahpundit/status/1388202698349154304;When Trump closed the US to incoming travelers from China at the height of its COVID infection numbers, he was condemned—including by Biden—as a xenophobe, but when Biden did the same thing for India at the apex of their COVID outbreak, he incurred no accusations of xenophobia, racism, or any breach of morality. Once again, as has been demonstrated many times in past entries, the standards that the left applies to its opponents doe not apply to the left’s champions. Their professed moral uprightness is simply a cudgel with which to destroy their opponents, and to which they have no intention of adhering. ;;2021-04-30;https://twitter.com/AliceFromQueens/status/1388340345147207680;Cancel culture proponents/apologists claim that there is no such thing as cancel culture, but the fact that every week brings a new round of cancellations, taking aim at progressively less public figures committing progressively more trivial infractions, makes it hard to deny that there is a cancel culture. As the author of this tweet points out, the only way they can fool the rest of us into thinking that cancel culture doesn’t exist is to lie and state that each round of cancellations is a separate phenomenon. But the transparency of this lie is starting to emerge, because the justification for cancellation—that it is the only means of defeating white supremacy—is under increasing strain. No rational person would think that exposing the mildly non-PC passing remarks of former Jeopardy contestants is strategically critical to defeating white supremacy. ;;2021-05-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1388646734998482946;While discussing the unsubstantiated and uncorroborated accusation that an opposing candidate sexually assaulted her, Jean Kim treats the matter completely flippantly despite resulting in the end of a person’s political career. In this particular case, her accusation seems incredibly flimsy. There were numerous fitting opportunities in the past for her to make her accusations public, such as when she worked on a different campaign opposing her alleged assailant. Additionally, after the alleged incident supposedly took place, she submitted an application to work on her alleged assailant’s campaign, which would be very strange behavior for a victim. These accusations suggest that, while it is certainly not the case of every accusation, Democrat operatives have discovered that claims of sexual misconduct will reliably destroy their opponents’ reputations even when no evidence is presented. More revealingly, it illustrates that Democrats assign no importance to due process, and are willing to dispense with it to further their objectives. ;;2021-05-02;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-56960011;Democrats praised trans retired athlete Caitlin Jenner until she announced her opposition to their political aims: now she is persona non grata among them. Most recently, she stated her opposition to trans girls participating in girls athletics—despite the fact that Jenner would be in the best position to understand the nuances of this issue, as a trans woman herself, the left is still condemning her as a bigot against her own group. The left is willing to contort its logic to fit its own narrative. ;;2021-05-02;https://twitter.com/AnonMLatTw/status/1388929641667350532;The left is such a cult that anyone who opposes it, even former heroes, is immediately and mercilessly denounced. Caitlin Jenner, a trans woman, was lauded by the left for coming out as trans, thereby bringing publicity to trans issues through her celebrity. But now that she is running for California governor as a Republican and has said that trans women should not compete in girls’ sports, the left has completely turned on her, condemning her as a retrogressive person. This behavior proves that the left does not adhere to a single consistent principle: whatever the dogma is at a given moment, the dissenters from that dogma are evil and the proponents of it are good, no matter what position those individuals respectively held prior to the given moment. ;;2021-05-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1389199503211864064;The fact that supposedly educated, and implicitly left-leaning, groups of people consistently contravene guidance from the CDC on COVID protection proves that the left’s dedication to “science” is all show and no substance. A liberal town in Massachusetts with the highest rate of post-secondary degrees dismissed the CDC’s guidance that masks were not necessary among vaccinated individuals outside, instead insisting that the municipal mask mandate remain in place. This is purely for optics and being able to lord superiority over others: they want to be seen wearing masks, even if doing so flies in the face of CDC guidelines. ;;2021-05-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1389205512433065985;Proving once again that the Democrats stand for authoritarianism and the abrogation of civil rights, Biden is invoking the Capital Riot to explicitly cooperate with private sector tech companies to spy on Americans, presumably to circumvent constitutional protections. It doesn’t matter that the Capital Rioters did not kill anyone, at most committing mild property damage and shoving some police officers, Biden and the Democrats are bent on using it as a pretext to bring the full might of the state down upon their political enemies. Even when Trump vowed to go after Antifa, which routinely set buildings on fire and beat people to death, he did not increase state surveillance powers. ;;2021-05-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1389218234138759172;In order to vilify their opponents, the left has appointed itself arbiter of the conduct of human interpersonal relationships and created their own contrived rules which they then apply arbitrarily. In order to torpedo the campaign of a Democrat primary challenger who goes against the grain of the party at large, Democrat operatives have invented the concept of a “nonconsenual relationship,” stating that if a man has a higher power status than a woman, regardless of whether he directly wields it over her and regardless of any other factors, it is impossible for the woman to consent to it even if she expressly does consent. In the process of trying to find a pretext for skewering their opponents as misogynists, the left is ironically the perpetrator of misogyny: they are basically saying that a woman is incapable of exercising her free rights as an adult to consent when a man’s social position demands extra consideration. They’re taking agency away from women to supposedly give women greater agency: decreeing when women can and cannot consent. ;;2021-05-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1389266304536825859;When directly confronted by a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, mainstream national news outlets almost universally refuse to retract stories that are proven to be completely false—of course, these stories reflect badly on Republicans. The most galling hypocrisy is that the same journalists at these major outlets who refuse to correct the record when a glaring mistake is brought to their attention are the same ones who insist that censorship must be wielded to stop “disinformation,” by which they mean false of merely objectionable claims by those on the political right. Like Democrats have proven to be without exception (at least on the national level), these media figures demand that others adhere strictly to rules of veracity while expecting exemptions from those rules for themselves and their allies. ;;2021-05-04;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/05/04/latino-leaders-demand-ban-on-police-foot-chases-until-new-policy-is-created-this-has-to-end-right-now/;Left activists are proposing that if a criminal runs from the police, the police shouldn’t chase them but instead let them go to potentially inflict violence and injury on the community. The left’s view is completely divorced from reality: that such a policy would simply reassure criminals that they can act with impunity and thus lead to more violent crime. ;;2021-05-04;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1389607206505664514;A journalist who has spent his entire life in service of leftist ideals exposes the Woke movement for what it is: pathetic wannabe despots bent on imposing their will on others to make up for their own self-inflicted failure. The Woke movement is being propelled mainly by Millennials, who are definitely as low on success metrics as reported, but refuse to acknowledge that they are to blame for their failure due to their inability to cope with anything outside their control and their unwillingness to subordinate their inflated egos to do any work that they deem beneath them. Instead of accepting their failings and making the best of sub-optimal circumstances of the 21st century, they have centered their “culture” (to the extent that it can even be called that) on toppling everyone else and subordinating them to their deep-seated tyrannical animus. In essence, they want to control everyone else to avenge themselves for the “injustice” that produced their failure. And in doing so, they don’t care what irreparable damage they inflict on their society—in fact, they on some level wish to destroy society, because they (correctly) assess that they are not able to coexist with it. Instead, they desire a society that caters to their every whim, no matter whose expense this must come at. ;;2021-05-05;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1389944865459425282;In the framework of the left’s beliefs (as Greenwald so shrewdly points out), small businesses are not allowed to invoke the First Amendment in their refusal to defer to Woke ideology, but giant monopolistic tech companies must enjoy unfettered First Amendment rights in moderating their platform (which, of course, is carried out expressly to ban anyone right of center). More specifically, a small-business baker was not allowed to decline baking a cake for a gay wedding even by claiming that supporting a gay wedding violated their First Amendment right of free exercise of religion, but Facebook is allowed to point to the First Amendment when banning Trump. When taking the left’s behavior on the whole, not only is it plainly and egregiously hypocritical, but stunningly deferential to corporate and state power. The left, which supposedly stands with the working class and against corporations, would rather deny First Amendment rights to a self-employed baker and insists on affirming the First Amendment rights of a massive, multi-billion dollar corporation with the power to control large swaths of media consumption on the Web. The irony would be rich if it weren’t such a dangerous precedent. ;;2021-05-05;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1390020916801855489;The ACLU has become such a subservient, unapologetic organ of Democrat propaganda that high-level employees are using their public presence to defame the left’s opponents with utter lies. Chase Strnagio, in attacking those who dared to criticize the left from the meager bulwarks of Substack, he claimed that one of his opponents, Bari Weiss, made a hateful statement targeting trans people which no record corroborate. Worse, when the lie was called out, Strangio refused to apologize or retract his false claim. The left is evidently so desperate to find enemies and paint itself as the victim that it will fabricate offenses committed against them. ;;2021-05-05;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1390090132691300353;The official twitter account of the Democratic Party openly called for the silencing of Trump on Facebook. As Greenwald aptly states, the Democrats at their core stand for censorship and authoritarianism, embracing corporate titans in order to realize their purge of any voices to the right of the political center from the Internet, a medium so pivotal to modern communication that to be exiled from is essentially to not exist. Now no one can deny that ti is literally the view of one party that all viable opponents should not be allowed to communicate on the Internet, without which modern political movements are impossible. ;;2021-05-07;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/5/7/protester-at-blm-rally-on-why-he-took-part-in-minneapolis-arson;[Citation that BLM protesters were not all peaceful, as evidenced by a protester admitting to setting fire to a police building with people inside.];;2021-05-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1390646807881977859;A woman who works as a journalist tweeted to demand that “the authorities” censor other journalists, namely those at Fox News, because she despises them for providing a forum for views she doesn’t like. And in making this request, she appealed to the “shouting fire in a theater” defense, which was coined in a Supreme Court opinion upholding the imprisonment of an anti-war activist handing out pamphlets during WWI arguing merely that the war was unjust and imprudent—literally, to defend her stance as not constituting censorship, she cites a Supreme Court opinion whose intended aim was justifying censorship. Here is yet more evidence that nearly all journalists with national reach are so desperate to serve as Democrat operatives that they are falling over themselves to demand government censorship, something which, in theory, is completely antithetical to the work of journalists. ;;2021-05-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1390646807881977859;The Guardian, an entity that characterizes itself as a media outlet but a more closely operates as a messaging arm of the Democrats, recently mused that the UK Labour party could have performed better with the working class if they had emulated Biden, who lost ground with the working class in 2020 compared to Clinton’s working class support in 2016. Biden got a smaller share than Clinton, as a percentage and in absolute terms, with every demographic except for white males. On the other hand, Biden gained a significant share of upper-middle class white males. This is the exact opposite of attracting the working class. But rather than acknowledging this truth, which polling data clearly illustrates, the handmaidens of the Democrats are instead practicing historical revisionism to lie and say Biden won the support of the working class. This isn’t just wrong, it’s a dangerous and cynical lie, which the Democrats and their allies advance to give themselves legitimacy they didn’t earn. ;;2021-05-07;https://twitter.com/SamAdlerBell/status/1390794335445209091;Democrat-proxy journalists are deriding a conservative colleague for asking Biden’s press secretary about funding that the US NIH did in fact give to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and about Biden’s stance on the in fact seriously considered (by scientists in good standing around the world) the theory that the SARS-CoV-2 originated from a leak from the Wuhan Institute of Virology labs. Because this possibility is inconvenient to the Democrats’ narrative, their allies in the media are dismissing as a “cuckoo conspiracy theory” a theory that is actively under investigation because it has not been conclusively ruled out (and the actual origin of the outbreak is still unknown as of this date). ;;2021-05-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1391025498164277248, https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1391042947110641664, https://twitter.com/jeremyscahill/status/1391056415511482368;The left is piling onto Trump—grasping desperately at Trump malfeasance scoops now that he’s out of office and no longer producing raw material they can package into Democrat propaganda—for using the Justice Department to reveal a reporter’s source, but conveniently forget that Obama did the same thing far more frequently than Trump has (at least provably, to this point). Democrat-allied  journalists are literally tweeting breathlessly, pretending like Trump has crossed a serious and unprecedented line by using the state to go after a journalist’s source, when in fact this is not unprecedented, and done numerous times under Obama. Not was Trump’s Justice Department not the first to go after sources, but Biden’s Justice Department defended Trump’s, saying that no abuse of power or wrongdoing was committed. Certainly, we should condemn any and every instance in which the government tries to chill the press, but this should be done on principle and not on partisan lines—it is alarming when any president engages in this behavior, not just when a Republican does so. ;;2021-05-10;https://twitter.com/MattBruenig/status/1391743309966675969;A civil society data analysis company has not only corroborated 2020 Election Day exit polls showing that Trump gained ground (in percentage and absolute terms) with non-white groups and with women, but actually shows that the majority of the votes he won came from these groups. In other words, white men were a minority of Trump voters—actually, they were in 2016 as well, but their share of his voters shrank in 2020. Again, while the left decried Trump as racist for 4 years, the data doesn’t bear it out. What makes more sense, that all the women and racial minorities that voted for Trump have been brainwashed by a cabal of white supremacists that secretly run the United States into voting against their “racial allegiance,” or that these voters so fed up with the elitism of the Democratic Party that they wanted to deliver it a death blow? Whether or not Trump is objectively racist or sexist, clearly a large group of racial minorities and women don’t believe that he is. In insisting that Trump is racist and sexist in spite of now even more data, the left is essentially saying that racial minorities and women are too stupid to know when someone is being racist or sexist toward them—THAT, the way the left regards those who disagree with it, is the true racism and sexism.;;2021-05-10;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1391858094624362497;Yet another civil society group is calling for censorship online so that it isn’t browbeaten for insufficient virtue signaling and loyalty to the radical-left’s party line. In an interview for Axios, a spokesperson for GLAAD flat-out demanded that social media censor anyone who says anything she doesn’t like about LGBTQ people. And, as numerous past incidents have amply proven, these calls for censorship will not be limited to the sort of hate speech that is covered in US law already, but anything that contradicts LGBTQ and Critical Theory activists’ objectives, dogma, or talking points (mostly around trans activism). For instance, it is now deemed “transphobic” to debate, using reason and scientific evidence, whether or not trans girls can fairly compete with biologically female girls in school athletics. It has likewise been deemed hateful to discuss the number of trans people who have “detransitioned,” for doctors to advise caution to those considering transitioning, or to even suggest that trans people may regret the changes they make to their bodies. These are all things that are done for the benefit of the mental and physiological health of trans people, and they are all being dismissed out of hand as “transphobic.” It is substantive and well-meaning debate like this that calls for social media censorship will swiftly stamp out. ;;2021-05-11;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57066497;Biden denies that Democrats throwing extended unemployment benefits, an eviction freeze, and stimulus payment after stimulus payment at people is not at all disincentivizing them to get jobs.

As Greenwald, founder of The Intercept, points out, when media outlets turn their attention and “critical reporting” on individuals who do not enjoy public standing, they have a moral obligation to their readership to explain why they have undertaken this project. The Intercept has offered no such explanation: they are simply going full speed ahead on outing as many “white supremacists” as possible, regardless of whether or not these individuals have committed any actual harms and regardless of how many ordinary, unassuming Trump voters get swept up in their McCarthyist campaign.;;2021-05-13;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1392859256647471111;The Democrats are so bent on the destruction of the Republican party that, at a time when numerous other crises beg for their attention, they are instead focusing on an internal Republican party dispute to martyrize a dissenting Republican House member. At a time when a cyberattack disabled a major gas pipeline, Israeli-Palestinian tensions are flaring up, and job growth is anemic, the Democrats are turning the majority of their attention to Liz Cheney, the daughter of one of their most hated ideological foes, because the Republican party is demoting her for clashing with the party consensus. Not only are they neglecting their duties to ogle at the other party’s internal matters, but the Democrats are pronouncing this minor intra-party scuffle as a grave threat to Democracy. This, of course, is to rekindle the fear from within their (the Democrats’) own ranks that sparked after the Capital Riot. By keeping the “threat to democracy” rhetoric alive, they extend their pretext for passing draconian security state laws, which they will then primarily direct at their ideological opponents to a far greater extent than any true national security threats (if only because there are significantly more Republicans than domestic terrorists). This is a complete abdication of their governing duties to feign alarm over “democracy” and run cover for granting themselves more security state powers. ;;2021-05-13;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1392891833785757703;Left-wing media outlet turned Democrat attack dog, The Intercept, has now taken to outing reporters who cover Antifa riots for the strongly implied purpose of training Antifa’s sights on them for intimidation and reprisal with physical violence. The Intercept recently produced a long-form video piece in which they prominently and repeatedly showed the names and faces of journalists who covered Antifa riots so that Antifa would find and attack them. Antifa is not only known for violence against perceived “fascists,” which to them is anyone to the political right of  them, but is not above literal murder. So The Intercept’s profile on these young adversarial reporters could very well get them killed. We’re literally at the point where a left-wing media outlet is sicking a violent mob on reporters who break stories that dare to challenge the left. ;;2021-05-14;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-57109040;Democrats decried a House Republican shouting at a House Democrat as “verbal assault” despite the fact that the left constantly screams at the right and thinks nothing of it. Literally, mobs of left protesters will surround innocent bystanders minding their own business (such as eating a meal at a restaurant outside), scream in their faces, and demand that they submit to the will of the mob, and the Democrats have never condemned this practice. ;;2021-05-14;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1393257051321774084;Journalists who clearly carry water for the Democrats are pronouncing an internal Republican decision on who will enjoy leadership positions as worse than the deadliest attack on the United States since Pearl Harbor. In the the wake of Representative Liz Cheney’s being demoted in House leadership by the Republicans, USA Today journalist proclaimed that “Republicans prove they’re a bigger threat than 9/11 hijackers.” This hyperbole, making a comparison between Republicans enforcing firm boundaries on adherence by their members to certain party platform planks and violent extremists ramming airplanes into buildings to kill thousands, is a slap in the face to everyone who everyone who lost loved ones in that harrowing national tragedy. But again, these histrionics are all to preserve the Democrats’ ability to heap national security state powers on themselves so that they can wield these powers against their political foes—ironic because they accused Trump of doing the same despite a dearth (though not absence) of evidence that he did so. ;;2021-05-17;https://twitter.com/CurtisHouck/status/1394431000533422080;Left-wing media has arrogated unto itself the right to not only defame the left’s ideological opponents, but to pick them out as targets for violent mobs, but when even the slightest rational, good-faith criticism is leveled against these same media entities, they claim that they are being threatened with violence. The Intercept recently published a lengthy video profile on two journalists who cover Antifa street violence, a thinly veiled directive for Antifa to target these journalists for violent retaliation. But if anyone takes issue with the factual accuracy or ethical soundness of anything that outlets like The Intercept publish—particularly if the journalist being criticized is non-white, non-male, or part of some other Democrat bloc identity group—they scream that they are being assailed by “violence” from their critics. This is an extremely perilous double-standard to allow, as it permits the left to carry out any campaign of repression, by any means ranging from ostracism to violent attacks, while any discourse which opposes them is labeled as violence which in turn justifies the very repression that prompted it. ;;2021-05-18;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1394721743961530369, https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1394726914846117888;When Trump made decisions that negligibly benefited Russia, he was accused of treason or coercion by Russia, but when Biden makes significantly larger concessions to Russia, no one accuses him of bowing to Russia. Less than a week after hackers in Russia (they do not as of now appear to be linked to the Russian government) extorted $5 million dollars via a ransomware attack from the Colonial Pipeline in the US, Biden dropped the US’s objections to Germany’s plan to purchase oil from Russia via a Russian pipeline. At the same time, Biden (via his press secretary) refuses to comment on whether the White House had any hand in Colonial’s decision to pay the ransomware attackers to resume the delivery of oil. Had Trump behaved in this way, the left would be calling for his metaphorical head for giving any ground to Russia. But when Biden gives way to Russia, with far more advantageous outcomes for Russia than anything Trump did, no one accuses Biden of selling out the country to Russia. ;;2021-05-19;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1395032094192046084;Ostensibly in the name of racial justice, the mayor of the 3rd-largest city in the US announced that she, an elected official answerable to all her constituents regardless of race or any other identity category, will only grant 1-on-1 interviews to nonwhite journalists. When Trump blocked individual Americans purely on the basis of whether they tweeted critical remarks at his account—and not on race or identity categories—he was sued for violating the First Amendment rights of the blocked users. But when Chicago’s Mayor Lightfoot, a Democrat and a black lesbian, prevents journalists from asking her questions to inform their audience explicitly based on race, this is considered acceptable. White people make up roughly 1/3 of Chicago residents, so this move essentially says that their access to her and their ability to directly pose questions to her doesn’t matter. If this isn’t blatant racism, more blatant than any racism that Trump supposedly engaged in, then nothing is. ;;2021-05-19;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1395114535263031299;The Democrats are insisting on conducting an extensive investigation of the Capital Riot in spite of the fact that it posed extremely minimal danger to life, property, or the integrity of American democracy, as all known facts about how the event transpired show. What the Democrats and their media allies continue to refer to as an “insurrection” was nothing more than a few hundred Trump supporters pushing past police officers and ambling around the halls of Congress for a few hours before leaving. The worst offenses the rioters could be said to have done (besides the offense of trespassing itself) is shoving a few police officers and breaking some windows and other mild property damage. They did not commit any homicides—far from it, the rioters were the only people who were victims of homicide. There is certainly cause to analyze failures in the security for the Capitol Building… but the Capitol Police have already conducted reviews of the incident and derived lessons for improved future preparedness. There is no practical need for further inquiry into the event. The only reason that Democrats are insisting on an investigation is because they want to continue to sow fear throughout their supporters so that they can justify (1) a campaign of suppression against all conservatives and (2) an expansion of security state powers to that end. Investigating the Capital Riot at this point is an entirely political project for the benefit of the Democrats, and not a good-faith effort to make Washington more secure. ;;2021-05-20;https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-fop-no-confidence-vote-20210520-nx3npn343nejrhsucbmfgnjcxa-story.html;Chicago police, who go out of their way not to enter the political arena (especially now at the height of BLM’s activity), ratified a no-confidence vote against Mayor Lightfoot.

Pelosi claimed that those who aren’t vaccinated are “selfishly a danger to other people,” but data on the vaccines shows that they are a extremely little risk of contracting a life-threatening case of COVID, and even a fairly low chance of contracting a mild case. The only people that the unvaccinated threaten are themselves—to claim otherwise is dishonest. ;;But this is only the latest emergence of evidence that the Democrats, who claim to believe in “the science” in fact do bot believe in it. Several Democrat governors and mayors are hesitant to lift mask mandates, or themselves stop wearing masks, despite the CDC recommendation that vaccinated individuals stop wearing masks. Pelosi’s vow to wear masks as long as House members remain who aren’t vaccinated doesn’t actually follow the CDC recommendation, the supposed “science.” The more likely explanation is not that she and her Democrat colleagues are too stupid to understand that, but that they don’t truly or fully trust the vaccine. This may stem from the fact that they are privy to intelligence and threat projections that indicate as much, but regardless of the reason, it appears they have reason to doubt the vaccine efficacy.

This is the kind of dishonesty that the Democrats routinely engage in. When a point of view is advanced by the Republicans, they dismiss it as crazy, but when they turn around and embrace the same point of view, they point to evidence and applaud their own supposedly elevated powers of judgment. It’s a practice that verges on gaslighting, and it’s a distinct favorite play for Democrats.

GLAAD has taken the lead in decrying a 60 Minutes report on trans issues as supposedly hateful for the simple act of giving any air time to those who are skeptical of the push to encourage more people to come out as trans. These are doctors and actual former trans people who have expressed serious, good-faith concerns that those considering transitioning are not adequately forewarned, and simply want to caution others who consider transitioning to be careful. The views expressed in the piece come nowhere close to what a reasonable, objective person would find hateful. Yet GLAAD is so hell-bent on crushing any suggestion that anyone should think twice about transitioning that they are using the accusation of intolerance as a form of censorship. Instead of participating in an rational discussion, GLAAD and groups like it prefer to censor their opponents—even their allies who simply advocate a modicum of caution. 
2021-05-24;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1396927221500088321;Prominent media that savaged Trump at every turn continue to put out Biden puff pieces, all the while claiming claim to be objective and holding all political office-holders to the same standards of scrutiny. The Washington Post published a piece today that seems to be solely dedicated to humanizing Biden, trying to convince us that he doesn’t really like Washington culture or the political limelight. This is the kind of piece that “mainstream” media would never publish about Trump, no matter how deserved. In fact, whenever Trump took a break to golf, the media would rake him over the coals for not being attentive enough to the duties of his office. But while the US is coming off of the disastrous Colonial Pipeline attack, managing a tenuous ceasefire in Gaza, carefully deescalating fraught tensions with Russia, and ratcheting up tensions with China, the Post thinks we should indulge Biden in some respite from the stresses of the presidency. This is yet another piece of evidence in the ironclad case that the media is firmly in the service of the Democratic Party, that they are the mouthpiece of and attack dog for the Democrats.

When it (like multiple social media platforms) suppressed the Hunter Biden reporting in the New York Post, Facebook vowed that they would publish a “fact-check” of the claims. Months later, this still has not been done. The reason why Facebook has quietly buried this promise of fact-checking is that it is now apparent that there was no evidence that any of the New York Post’s reporting was false. US intelligence services—the same services Trump spent 4 years maligning—publicly noted that it seemed like Russian disinformation (not that it was, and not accompanied by any proof). Then social media, whose executives donate overwhelmingly to Democrats, latched onto this claim from US intelligence as a pretext for routing users away from the New York Post story, effectively censoring it. Any attempt at true fact-checking would have revealed that US intelligence and social media acted in service of the same goal, to bury bad press about Biden, by suggesting the reporting was false when, in fact, the Bidens have never claimed the New York Post’s documents were false and no Russian disinformation was discovered.

The extremely clear facts should not need to be reiterated, but the rioters were largely unarmed and did not inflict grave bodily hard on anyone, they loitered around the Capitol Building for a few hours, and then left without obstructing the democratic process and manifesting no further “threat” that day or in the many weeks that followed. It is simply nowhere on the scale of devastation that 9/11 and its direct consequences wrought, with thousands of lives lost and billions of dollars spent in overseas wars. 
2021-05-26;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1397623499888463872;On the same day that the Biden administration conceded that there was a possibility that SARS-CoV-2 originated in the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a journalist who supposedly specializes in medical reporting panned the “lab leak”theory as racist without offering any evidence for her contention. As Greenwald, who retweeted and commented on this journalist’s statement, pointed out, there is nothing racist about the possibility that Chinese researchers committed errors that led to the escape of a virus like coronavirus. If anything, as he shrewdly assess, is is more racist to insinuate that the the primitive Chinese practice of “wet markets” must have been the origin of the virus, and that it couldn’t have been an error in the course of the scientific process, which happens around the world all the time to even the most seasoned research teams. There is currently no working theory as to where the coronavirus came from—new evidence has cast enough doubt on the “wet market” theory that it has essentially been ruled out. Not only does this journalist condemn as racist the mere initiative to conduct an investigation into the possibility of a lab leak, but she doesn’t even offer up a competing, supposedly more plausible and less racist counter-narrative, which just shows that she doesn’t have one. In fact, she subsequently deleted her tweet on the grounds that it was “badly phrased”, conceding the so-obvious-it-shouldn’t-require-articulating point that it is worthwhile to know the origins of a deadly pandemic. The more likely explanation is that she knows she is wrong and has no leg to stand on, but she is hiding behind the facade of the need to conduct an “important line of reporting”.

It’s dangerous enough when anyone makes an unfounded claim that an ideological opponent is acting in service of foreign enemy, but the fact that this is being done by people who characterize themselves as journalists is alarming. Along with scientists, journalists are theoretically the last people who should being making unsubstantiated claims. Yet because so many media outlets with prominent national audiences are petrified by the possibility of dissenting views be heard, in response to such views they scramble to tar the views’ authors as essentially traitors. And, of course, because these peddlers of slander are clothed in the garb of journalists, their audiences will take these smears as the truth with minimal questioning. It’s also ironic that these left-wing organizations are specifically alleging that their opponents are in league with Russia, since this exact same tactic was used against them during the Cold War.

This is the kind of thing that, if the Democrats stayed consistent with their supposed principles, they should condemn. But, of course, they didn’t condemn this because it supported their narrative: everyone should get the vaccine and anyone who doesn’t is a right-wing moron.

The one cornerstone of Woke policy goals is to give preferential funding and privileges to select identity groups, especially racial minorities. The reasoning for this is to essentially balance out differences in outcomes which the left assumes stem from injustice (and not one of many potential other causes, which they refuse to entertain or investigate). Pursuing equality of outcome is already perilous, since this is the very essence of communism: whether one works hard or doesn’t work at all, everyone should get the same reward. But on top of that, race-based allocation of welfare or government funding to achieve this equality of outcome is manifestly unfair and discriminatory, irrespective of the groups being discriminated against or the ends that it is intended to serve. Judge Amul Thapar’s judgment was just and perspicacious in striking down discrimination where he saw it, and in not being duped by the at best flawed and at worst dishonest rationale presented by the proponents of this discrimination. 
2021-05-28;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1398298825329106944;Congressional representatives are pitching a fit that their opponents are exercising their First Amendment rights to advocate that their supporters exercise their Second Amendment right to own firearms. In a speech criticizing social media platforms that have routinely skewed their censorship efforts (under the guise of “content moderation”) against Republicans, Representative Matt Gaetz stated to his supporters “we have a Second Amendment in this country and I think we have an obligation to use it.” The Second Amendment is merely that Americans have the right to own weapons, not the the right to use them in any manner they choose. There are still laws against violence, and Gaetz in no way advocated that those laws should be disregarded. But those who cave to the left are insisting that exhortations like this should be censored because they don’t align with the prevailing political orthodoxy (i.e. the left). Once again, calls for censorship are being thrown around more and more casually, and being accepted by more and more of the voting public. It is somewhat surprising that this specific condemnation emanates from a Republican, but this individual appears to be styling himself as a “Never Trumper” Republican in the mold of Mitt Romney. This could merely be a prelude to a change in party allegiance, or a gambit to survive what he thinks will be a purge of Trumpism from the Republican party. The latter case has been put forward by media personalities, promoting a “de-Baathification” of the Republican Party, so this stance may just prove prudent. Regardless of the reason, by toeing the line drawn by the Democrats on which views are allowed to be expressed and which are not, Kinzinger’s party affiliation is irrelevant. By subscribing to the censorship regime of the left, the left’s most significant project, he works for the left.
2021-05-29;https://twitter.com/tomgara/status/1349824987528650760;By ending its ban on discussion of the “lab leak” theory for the origin of coronavirus on its platform just after the Biden administration’s announcement that it would investigate the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Facebook proved that it takes its censorship cues from the Democrats. Like nearly all social media, Facebook likes to claim that it serves no party, that it’s just upholding objective standards for what speech is acceptable and responsible to be aired. But the fact that it censored the discussion of the lab leak theory when Democrats wanted it censored, and stopped censoring it when the Democrats decided it merited serious consideration, shows that Facebook is beholden to the Democrats. This contention is not made in isolation, and this is not the only evidence. Facebook also aided in Biden’s election by suppressing the New York Post reporting that Hunter Biden may have secured his post on the board of a Ukrainian oil company because then-Vice President Biden wielded his influence. Facebook executives and employees also overwhelmingly donate to Democrats (compared to Republicans). With all of this evidence, it would be hard for anyone to deny that Facebook works for the Democrats in regards to speech regulation… just as the Democrats work for Facebook by declining to regulate Facebook in any meaningful way.

This shows how vacuous and intellectually dishonest the Woke movement is, because it is clearly not about fighting racism. If it were, its leaders would have a much more cogent, rational, and objective definition for the term, “racism”, which represents the phenomena it is wholly dedicated to opposing. By keeping the definition of their target intentionally slippery and subjective, they can apply the labels of “racist” and “racism” to anything the Woke wish to destroy with little effort. By making “racist” mean essentially anything they oppose on any grounds, Woke adherents can instantly put a bullseye on anyone or anything, and the rank and file will not question the validity of this targeting. As McWhorter points out, what is truly racist is exempting “scholars” of racial minority backgrounds from the basic requirements of sound argumentation. It implies that these people aren’t capable of making reasoned arguments, so they should be allowed engage in shoddy debating. If that isn’t truly and objectively racist—saying nonwhite people must be allowed to make inferior arguments because we can’t expect them to do better—then nothing is.

It’s at the point where a number of high-profile allegations of misconduct by the left have no substance of any kind—and they must know it—but they level the allegations nonetheless because (1) the left knows they will instantly be believed irrespective of evidence and (2) everyone is afraid to call out what a shameful deception this is. If one exposes this tactic, one suffers the same tactic against them. If the left had the truth on its side, they could show real evidence to support their claims and actual justice would have a chance to be served. The fact that they issue these condemnations where admission and denial of guilt both mean guilt is an admission that the left is morally bankrupt—it’s the tactic reserved only for charlatans, abuses, and authoritarians.
2021-06-04;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1400792789349277702;When the private communications of any Trump-aligned politicians or bureaucrats circulate, journalists swarm over them to suss out any wrongdoing, but when an influential anti-Trump government figure’s communications leak, journalists at major outlets ignore it. Recently, Dr. Fauci’s emails were leaked online, providing journalists and truth-seekers to get an inside look at how one of the nation’s top public health experts approached the pandemic when it initially reached the US. This has the potential to yield invaluable insight into how our government manages crises. But because most journalists with large platforms, figures almost universally aligned with the Democrats as evidenced by the overall slant of their editorial decisions, don’t want a hero of the left to look bad, they don’t bother reviewing the documents. This makes even less sense when considering that Fauci is a bureaucrat, unaligned with any party and serving the holder of the office of president, thus insulating both parties from criticism by criticizing him. But because the left embraced Fauci, the media is protecting his reputation as if he were a Democrat. This is a clear case of journalistic malfeasance—when the chance to shed light on a powerful figure presents itself, journalists are professionally (if not morally) obligated to seize upon it. But this episode shows just how blindly loyal the media is to the Democrats: they’d rather leave the public uninformed than make the Democrats look bad for an association they went out of their way to willingly make. 
2021-06-05;https://twitter.com/adamjohnsonNYC/status/1401202654714421248;The same pro-left journalist who melodramitcally exhorted Biden to take a harder line against the “autocrats” who are active in the US (by which the journalist means anyone who voted for Trump irrespective of any other political activity they did or did not engage in) writes propaganda for a tyrannical Middle Eastern regime to entice wealthy Americans to take its investment money. Literally, this journalist is calling rank and file Republicans and their supporters tyrants while at the same time whitewashing the antidemocratic behavior of actual tyrants who deprive their people of the right to vote or to have any rights. This is a particularly vivid and egregious example, but this is the kind of hypocrisy that is common among left-wing operatives (whether or not they explicitly self-identify as such). If nothing else, anyone who supports the Democrats and doesn’t speak out against their zealous push to get all right-of-center voices censored online have no leg to stand on when it comes to criticizing “authoritarian” behavior—there is nothing more authoritarian than condoning, explicitly or implicitly via apathy, than allowing citizens to be censored in flagrant violations of the principles (if not the legal mandate) of the First Amendment. 
2021-06-06;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1401567198829817864;Live on his show during an interview of Biden’s press secretary, a highly visible journalist in the mainstream press asked her how she would like the Biden administration to be covered. This is nothing short of a revolting abdication of journalistic responsibility, motivated by the overriding desire to please the Democrats which this journalist and the majority of his colleagues serve. A journalist’s job is to be adversarial to those in power, not to give them the privilege of requesting positive coverage from the media. To stoop to this kind of pathetic sycophancy is to fail the public that one supposedly serves as a reporter. 
2021-06-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1401903115318837251;Because of how much clout it provides in liberal-dominant spaces—mainstream media, culture, and academia foremost among them—to possess a victim or marginal identity, it is now commonplace to see public figures identifying as LGBT. Claiming an identity that fits into the left’s identity politics framework is so routine that Glenn Greenwald, a journalist who has subscribed to leftist politics his whole life, is even starting to criticize it. This is a significant development for a few reasons. First, it demolishes the left’s narrative that there is nothing to be gained from being a member of a “marginalized” group. The left loves to claim that it takes bravery to acknowledge and/or live as a member of a marginalized identity, but among their own circles, the complete opposite is true. The more “oppressed” identities one has, the more respect and adulation they receive, and the higher their views are regarded. 
Second, the ease with which LGBT membership is assumed by individuals who have shown no particular affinity or kinship with it 5 to 10 years ago, is a slap in the face to LGBT people who have truly suffered discrimination. There are homosexual men and women who sacrificed much to gain legal equality, and now people who have never suffered for anything are butting into their group and claiming that they, too, are marginalized. And finally, this trend shows how transparently self-serving and manipulative the Woke movement is. Statistically, there is no way that as many people are “queer” as claim that they are. The explosion of people who identify as LGBT does cleanly correlate to greater acceptance of LGBT people: the biggest jump in LGBT self-identification should have occurred after gay marriage was legalized in 2015. Instead, it is in the last 2 years that there has been a sudden spike in self-identification with this group. This trend would appear to correlate with the Woke movement getting more aggressive in its character assassinations and deplatforming of its opponents in the late Trump years. So this shift in self-identification is not due to huge gains in rights or acceptance, but due to people wanting to selfishly align with the dominant politics. It’s all to get superior treatment in the most influential circles of society, and has nothing to do with standing up for one’s rights. It is not the brave act it was even a decade ago—quite the opposite, it is the cowardice of not wanting the Woke mob to cast you into oblivion. ;;2021-06-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1401903115318837251, https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1401992998016147456, https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/7/harris-meets-guatemalan-president-tackles-immigration;While running for office, Biden and Harris professed their compassion for immigrants and their intention to liberally accept refugees, only for Harris to less than 6 months into her term tell refugees that they are not welcome in the US. Once again, the Democrats prove that they stand for nothing, have no spine or morals, and will lie to the faces of their supporters to cling to power. Anyone who votes for a Democrat expecting them to put in even an ounce of effort to fulfill campaign promises is a fool. What makes this particular episode so noteworthy, is how brazenly the Democrats contradicted everything they’ve ever promised to their base on an issue. It wasn’t just that Harris announced the US’s intention to deny asylum seekers. It’s that she didn’t even use the left’s PC term “undocumented immigrants” but called them “illegal migrants”—almost identical to Republicans’ supposedly “racist” (in the left’s view) term “illegal immigrants”. And, of course, the accusations against Harris of racism are few, whereas if Trump had said this, he would be condemned as a racist. Yet again, the media, activists, and the left impose a double-standard on Republicans that they never adhere to themselves. ;;2021-06-07;https://twitter.com/SirajAHashmi/status/1402013173683732480;People who subscribe to Woke politics are literally criticizing non-white people for the mere act of having white friends, the most naked act of racism that one could possibly find in the last decade. The same people who preach tolerance of other races are literally being outwardly intolerant of white people, and of any non-white person who would associate with them. Anyone who embraces this view has no legitimate claim to any moral authority of any kind, certainly not on matters of racial “justice”, equality, or harmony.;;2021-06-08;https://twitter.com/tomselliott/status/1402218237048279041;A left-wing reporter interviewed on CNN expressed alarm that conservatives were flying “American flags”, implying that there is something insidious about the literal symbol of our nation which we all share in equally. In making this remark, she inadvertently tipped her hand as a leftist to reveal that the left thinks that America is a shameful place and that we (especially whites) are all guilty of this shame unless we follow their prescription to remedy it to the letter—and even then, we will still have a shameful country. ;;2021-06-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1402356890642915332;NPR is reporting that two of the lawyers who have represented Trump as president are representing those accused in connection with the Capital Riot, insinuating that this is somehow sinister. This is another case where the left—NPR is well-known for its leftward slant—do not value the rule of law. The left does not believe that you have a right to an attorney if the accused runs afoul of their political objectives, and so cast skepticism on the idea that such a person is worthy of defense in court before they are deprived of their liberty by the state. The left’s position on this, as evidenced by its actions, undermines the most fundamental fabric of our democracy: that the state does not get to unilaterally strip citizens of their liberty. But the left is so hell-bent on imposing its will that anything, even the constitution or civil liberties, that gets in its way must be dismantled. ;;2021-06-09;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1402603356045127683;A former high-ranking FBI official on cable TV advocated arresting sitting members of Congress in order to combat the “terrorism” posed by the conservative movement. It should shock the conscience of every American to hear an ex-federal law enforcement chief seriously and openly propose rounding up people and imprisoning them purely for exercising their constitutionally protected First Amendment rights. This should be taken for the alarming threat to freedom that it is. ;;2021-06-09;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1402628280017207306;The left, which outwardly professes its opposition to the police, has the highest approval rating the FBI, the highest law enforcement authority in the US. Those who identify with the Democratic Party are apparently unfazed by the hypocrisy of campaigning for a radical overhaul, if not outright abolition, of the police while supporting the highest “police” force in the nation—one that has a history of targeting their political camp with surveillance. This is yet another piece of evidence that the Democrats don’t stand for anything other than their own power. It doesn’t matter that they are hypocrites for condemning the police while venerating the FBI, because the FBI preserves their grip on power. ;;2021-06-09;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1402684619279982608;In a cable news interview, the left’s favorite bureaucrat opponent of Trump, Fauci, asserted that criticizing him is synonymous with criticizing science in order to insulate himself from any criticism. Such charlatanism should be transparent—his remark wouldn’t pass muster in a high school debate team—and yet he had the audacity to equate himself with science, a proxy for absolute truth in the minds of many (especially those on the left). This reasoning (if you can call it that) makes for a brilliant ploy because then it empowers the speaker to make any desired claim in the future and have the force of “science” behind it. Of course, he brandished this propagandistic rhetorical flourish, in true Democrat fashion, just as published copies of his emails show that while he publicly downplayed the “lab leak” theory he secretly gave it credence in internal public health discussions. ;;2021-06-09;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1402719133570158597;Yet again, an anti-Trump hit job zealously pursued by the left-wing media turns out to be demonstrably and completely false. The assertion that Trump ordered police to use tear gas to disperse a crowd so he could hold a photo op was found out to be totally untrue. An inspector general report, by a figure who served under Obama, proved with ample documented evidence that the orders to clear the park were submitted and put into effect days before Trump signaled any intention to visit the park. The report literally contains references to hard, irrefutable documents, and yet there are still some news outlets that refuse to admit that they lied—many have admitted their mistake, but not all have even when there is no way they can justify their recalcitrance. ;;2021-06-10;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1403037367930339336;A white reporter interviewing a black Republican congressman insinuates, to his face, that he must be a moron for supporting Trump because Trump is “racist”. The white journalist’s incredulity that a black man in Congress could support Trump is far more racist than anything Trump could have possibly done, because it implies that this black House of Representatives member couldn’t possibly have his own rational, valid reasons for supporting Trump—it must be because he didn’t have the intellect t realize that he was supporting a “racist”. To suggest that black people aren’t capable of identifying racism that a white person can supposedly see clearly is the epitome of racism. To compound this racism is the hypocrisy of the Democrats who refuse to admit this black member of Congress into the Congressional Black Caucus. The Democrats love to talk a big game about how they are SO inclusive of different backgrounds and viewpoints, yet they would not admit exactly the kind of diverse viewpoint, who otherwise met the racial criteria for joining the CBC, on precisely his viewpoints. This is yet more proof that the Democrats do not value diversity, that they truly care nothing for racial justice, but simply use race to advance their selfish, self-perpetuating agenda. ;;2021-06-10;https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/6/10/cdc-advisers-to-review-heart-inflammation-link-to-mrna-covid-jabs;Hundreds of teenagers who have taken the mRNA COVID “vaccines” have suffered inflammation of the heart at an alarming rate. When 7 in 7 million Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients suffered blood clotting, the distribution of the vaccine stopped in the US and Europe, yet when a much higher incidence of heart inflammation occurs in children from the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, no halt or pause in distribution occurred. ;;2021-06-12;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1403692047459143688;When left-allied media thinks no one is watching, they admit that they are in lockstep with the Democratic Party in pursuing the same political objectives. In a panel discussion hosted on MSNBC, CNN journalist Brian Stelter noted that he sought to work with the with the White House, meaning the Biden administration, to crack down on “disinformation”—which is, of course, code for any ideas or reporting that the left doesn’t like. The lab leak theory for coronavirus’s origin, claims of the “Russian bounty” and Trump-Russian collusion stories’ falsehood, and the validity of the Hunter Biden laptop story (which the Bidens still haven’t refuted as untrue) were all dismissed as “disinformaiton” by the left, only to later be found to be true. So when the media or Democrats talk about disinformaiton, they aren’t pursuing a good-faith effort to elevate the truth, but to silence their political opponents, which are in common between them. ;;2021-06-13;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1404192804771860483;Woke advocates (this time in the media) are so desperate to advance their claim that racism is everywhere that they are spreading lies that US schools are teaching that “slavery was not so bad”. US schools are one of the most, if not the most, Woke-saturated sectors of society—leftists have been flocking to education for decades, which polls of political affiliations among teachers will readily prove. The idea that schools are secretly advancing slavery apologism—and getting away with it unnoticed—is completely absurd and patently false. If leftists could empirically demonstrate that racism was omnipresent, why would they feel compelled to make up lies like this? The answer is, spouting lies like this only makes sense if their premise of “systemic racism” is actually false. ;;2021-06-14;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1404410620036980739;Biden, whose supporters in part lobbied for his election because of supposedly superior mental faculties to Trump, confused Syria with Libya 3 times in the span of 90 seconds. Cognitive difficulty like this in a leader with overwhelming and unilateral military, diplomatic, and economic power at his disposable should alarm everyone. However, Democrats and their supporters brush it aside, despite spending the entire Trump presidency arguing that Trump was mentally unfit for office, despite Trump never stumbling this egregiously. ;;2021-06-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1404784191766736905;In order to stoke fear, and thereby help the Democrats arrogate unto themselves more government power, leftist political operatives advancing unfounded claims that Trump will outlaw the Democratic Socialists of America if he is reelected. As Greenwald aptly points out, Democrats and their media allies keep crying wolf that Trump will come back and enact fascist policies so that they can (a) retain fading viewership and (b) justify more and more surveillance powers. Trump didn’t live up to their hopes of fascist rule, and yet they continue to insist that the REAL fascism is yet to come, and that submission to the Democrats’ every policy goal will save them. In this way, Democrats are radicalizing their base every bit as much as they claim Trump is radicalizing his. The Democrats’ base are the only people fooled by this posturing, but it is still dangerous because of how the Democrats use it as license, as political cover, to seize more power, which impacts everyone. ;;2021-06-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1404795916125605901;Even Democrat shill comedians are still cranking out Trump content because they are too lazy to do anything original months after he left office. Again, this would only be sad if it weren’t so dangerous that these entertainers’ left-leaning audiences believe increasingly more outlandish claims about Trump. It’s not that they literally believe comedy, but it’s that it erodes their resistance to the kind of lies that the media has steadily churned out about Trump: that he colluded with Russia, that he ignored Russian bounties on US troops, that he ordered a park cleared of left-wing protesters for a photo op, that his supporters beat a cop to death, and countless more. It’s also disconcerting that one of two viable political parties is so obsessed with an opponent who is no longer in power that they could very well disintegrate if that opponent were to successfully challenge them again. ;;2021-06-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1404807826363535361;Left-wing journalists are so anti-Trump that they are willing to rat out sources to the FBI on the off-chance that it helps the FBI prove the Trump-Russia conspiracy they’ve been obsessively chasing. This is a complete abdication of journalistic responsibility, all out of desperation to comply with government entities working in service of Democrat-aligned objectives. Defeating Trump by any means possible is so paramount that a journalist was willing to betray a source they agreed to keep anonymous. It’s hard to find a more glaring example of unethical conduct. It also discourages every source for every journalist: now they know that, because the precedent has been set, all bets are off on whether they can expect protection for revealing the truth. Thus, the actions of one journalist have degraded the efforts of all of them. ;;2021-06-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1404833935956353025;When Trump supporters shove some cops and mill around the Capitol for a few hours, the left rushes to brand them a violent threat to life and democracy, yet when a radical leftist literally attempts to assassinates Republicans, left sympathizers feign complete mystification of what the assassin’s motives were. A former FBI agent went on CNN to discuss the “congressional baseball shooting”, in which a man who posted Rachel Maddow clips and ranted that Republicans were “traitors” subsequently attempted to gun down Republicans as they practiced for their congressional softball team. The former FBI official’s conclusion was that the assailant’s motives were not clear—any thinking person could tell you that his motives were crystal clear. If it had been a Trump supporter shooting Democrats, no one would be entertaining these ridiculous doubts surrounding the shooter’s motives. The proof of this is that the left has pronounced judgment on the Capital Riot participants, calling them “insurrectionists” and asserting that every single person who trespassed on the Capitol grounds intended the violent overthrow of the government. Nothing close to such a violent revolution happened, nor did it appear by their actions that any of the rioters intended that. Certainly, even if some intended revolution, clearly not all did, but to Democrats, this does not matter—they are all guilty of treason in the left’s eyes, no need for a trial.;;2021-06-16;https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1405273347055833090;When the filibuster works to serve their interests, the Democrats shroud it in the mantle of the “Founding Fathers” in its defense, but when the filibuster becomes the last refuge of their enemies, they invoke melodramatic war analogies in pursuing its destruction. Not only are they nakedly hypocritical about it, but the change in stance played out in a span of only 3 years, as shown by Durbin’s remarks. Here is yet more proof that the Democrats stand for nothing, and will take whatever stance serves them best in securing short-term gain. ;;2021-06-16;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1405160079947710466;The Democrats’ favorite partisan bureaucrat (Fauci) is now gaslighting the American people, saying that the “lab leak” theory for the origin of SARS-CoV2 was never dismissed or suppressed when social media companies censored even reason-based discussions of this theory. If it wasn’t the government’s intention to suppress discussion of this theory, then they should have asked that social media allow its discussion. At best, they did not intervene in the censorship of what they now admit is a valid line of scientific inquiry. At worst, they encouraged this censorship—while Fauci may not have ever called for censorship, some prominent Democrats and left-wing media figures did. But regardless, there’s no way that Fauci didn’t know about this censorship carried out by social media against users discussing the lab leak theory. So when he claims that it wasn’t happening, either he is so out of touch that he was unaware of policies affecting millions of social media users, or he’s lying and pretending he had no idea that this was the case—or worse, contending that it simply never happened.;;2021-06-16;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1405310663082139649;When Trump says “America First”, it’s a Nazi dog whistle, but when a Biden supporter says it about Biden, it’s a sincere expression of how Biden diligently serves the American people in conducting international diplomacy. ;;2021-06-16;https://twitter.com/CalebJHull/status/1405277134784851976;When Trump engages in a heated verbal exchange with a bold reporter, Trump is being a bully, but when Biden gets into a testy exchange with the same reporter (being similarly bold), Biden simply had an honest misunderstanding with her. ;;2021-06-16;https://twitter.com/ZaidJilani/status/1405284280457064453;A recent poll shows that 85% of those who self-identify as liberals would report a professor to the university if the professor made a remark in class that offended them. The poll wasn’t asking whether they should confront or engage in dialog with the professor, challenging the professor in more direct and constructive ways, but whether they would go straight to demanding disciplinary action by the university. This shows that not only do few liberals have any tolerance for disagreement or dissent, but that they have a censorious, authoritarian instinct that wants to see dissent swiftly and aggressively punished. It doesn’t matter that they are endangering someone’s livelihood and career—they will crush all deviation from their orthodoxy by immediately taking the most aggressive and strictest corrective. ;;2021-06-17;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1405659379198836745;A reporter interviewed on MSNBC argued that parents and civil society groups are in the wrong for filing FOIA requests to determine what public school teachers are teaching their children, and what money they are allocating to do so. This is astonishing for so many reasons. First, since public school teachers are government employees, parents have an intrinsic right as taxpayers to know how they administer their public service (educating youth). Second, it is mind-bogglingly ironic that a journalist, whose job is ostensibly to uncover the truth of the conduct of government officials, would speak out against citizens demanding information from the government that they have the legal right to obtain. Third, if what teachers are teaching students is reasonable and completely irreproachable, why is this journalist afraid of what the public will find out about public school curricula through filing FOIAs? What does this journalist think public schools have to hide? She focuses on condemning parents and civic organizations for trying to uncover Critical Race Theory in schools, and never actually argues that CRT is harmless. This is odd, suspicious behavior for a journalist, and for someone who has faith in the public school system. ;;2021-06-17;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/06/17/racism-public-health-crisis-mayor-lori-lightfoot/;In the middle of a pandemic and a surge in violent crime, instead of declaring either of these the focus of government policy and funding, Lightfoot declared that racism is the true public health crisis.

The narrative being pushed by left political and cultural operatives is that the vaccines, which have not existed for more than about a year and therefore cannot be assessed for their long-term safety implications, are perfectly safe and that anyone denying this is a deranged conspiracy theorist. And as anyone familiar with their messaging knows, they do all of this while claiming to “follow the science”. And yet despite this professed adherence to science, voices on the left will not even entertain the idea that there are significant risks associated with the production of cytotoxic substances within the human body. This evidence is NOT even saying that the mRNA vaccines are not potentially an appropriate risk in comparison to the risk of COVID infection, just that a previously un-acknowledged risk is present. But because this empirical evidence contradicts their contention that the vaccines are perfectly safe, they dismiss it. If the left is committed to producing the optimal public health outcome, what could possibly motivate them to dismiss evidence that a key public health control for the present pandemic may require re-evaluation and retooling? No truly rational, good-faith-acting person would do as the left is overwhelmingly doing in this case. The only explanations which remain are that either (1) the left is so invested in the virtue signal of embracing the vaccine that it would risk the cohesion of their political tribe to admit any shortcoming in the vaccine, or (2) the left politicians are doing the bidding of the pharmaceutical industry, and cannot admit any deficiency in the vaccine for fear of losing campaign donations. So either the left is pathologically tribal or institutionally corrupt, neither of which should afford them any moral high ground from which to lecture anyone else. ;;2021-06-24;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/6/24/giulianis-law-licence-suspended-over-trump-election-falsehoods;Because a pro-Democrat judge didn’t like how Giuliani exercised his First Amendment rights, the judge revoked Giuliani’s ability to practice law in the state of New York.

Radical left activists have made it their mission to co-opt or destroy any societal institution that does not conform to their views on race and how resources and civil liberties should be distributed in society. The sum total of the objectives they are pursuing by these means—as well as the aggregate of the means themselves—is referred to as Critical Race Theory, not by its opponents but by its leading academics and leaders. But when criticized, instead of acknowledging the ideology that they speak of openly in academic literature and activist meetings, they are now denying that they are doing anything like what Critical Race Theory teaches. Among themselves, and in their demands articulated in protests or public meetings, they articulate the objectives exactly as outlined by Critical Race Theory. But when Critical Race Theory is directly targeted by their ideological foes, they claim that Critical Race Theory is doing none of the things it in fact seeks to do. How can a movement that outwardly claims to promote “justice” act so duplicitously? How is this not the most suspicious behavior imaginable?;;2021-06-25;https://twitter.com/DrewHolden360/status/1408507667610537988;According to the rules of the left, you should get fired for deriding a left-wing public official, but you are allowed to deride a right-wing public official.

Rude. Stupid. Embarrassing.” Again, liberals insist on rules of decency and then exempt themselves whenever they transgress those same rules.

Literally, the Democrats believe it is racist to boycott the nation of Israel, which like the US is not racially homogeneous, as a rebuke of its policies toward the Palestinians, but Democrats see no problem with boycotting other states in their own country. This is the kind of double-dealing, self-serving logic that the Democrats at this point cannot refute for the abundance of evidence. Consistently Republican-controlled states don’t do this to consistently Democrat-controlled states. This is even more remarkable for the fact that hardcore socially conservative Republicans literally think that abortion is murder—so the one party that thinks the other is murdering babies isn’t even boycotting the other party’s states, while the other is boycotting the one for not going along with its radical social agenda.;;2021-06-29;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1407894659616104450;Non-white liberals are freely boasting on social media about how they have turned their white “friends” into submissive, self-effacing sheep who grovel at their feet for forgiveness of their original sin of being white. This not only shows the cult-like behavior of the left, but that their cult’s dogma preaches what any rational person would conclude to be manifestly disgusting, morally repugnant, and literally racist treatment of white people. The left browbeats their white adherents into throwing themselves at the mercy of their non-white leaders, and then holds this up as “justice”. Anyone who sees this abusive treatment as “justice” is morally bankrupt. ;;2021-06-30;https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-lightfoot-racism-sexism-20210630-yuyvypcfavadlfnybmk7sr7ucq-story.html;Chicago’s Lightfoot dismisses basically all criticism of her objectively disrespectful treatment of city council members (such as hurling profanities at them) as just people being racist.

It goes to show that concern about the safety of the vaccine cuts across political and demographic lines far more so than Democrats and their media and public health bureaucrat allies would lead us to believe. But since vaccine adoption rates seem to roughly coincide with left political affiliation rates, it is tempting to make the lazy assumption that nearly all on the left “believe in” the vaccine and that nearly all on the right do not. This, however, points to another interesting phenomenon: though roughly 1 in 4 young Americans has not taken the vaccine, the proportion that admits to this is far smaller—survey dating app profiles and see for yourself (admittedly anecdotally, but still). What does this mean? It means that most young people who haven’t taken the vaccine lie about it. For those who enforce social ostracism of those who have not vaccinated, members of this age group are more likely to have interacted with someone who hasn’t been vaccinated but lied and said they were than someone who will honestly admit to not vaccinating. Of course, this is all a moot point, because if you are vaccinated and the vaccine is as effective as public health experts claim, then there is nothing to fear from the unvaccinated. ;;2021-07-03;https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/03/health/unvaccinated-variant-factories/index.html;Democrat-allied media is spreading unscientific claims to scare people into getting vaccinated. Recently, CNN claimed that it is unvaccinated people who are driving the development of variant strains of COVID, but this is completely scientifically backwards. Those who aren’t vaccinated (and who have never contracted COVID before) have no immunity to COVID, so it would not need to evolve from the wild type (base) to infect them. In other words, in unvaccinated people, there is no added barrier that the coronavirus has to overcome to infect them, so the virus’s mutations are not accelerated. However, evidence shows that vaccinated people can still get infected and still spread the coronavirus—the severity of the infection is just lessened. These are the people that will accelerate the coronavirus’s mutation, since it will have to change its structure to circumvent the immunity provided by the vaccine in order to have a better chance of infecting more cells before it is wiped out.;;2021-07-03;https://www.axios.com/aoc-shacarri-richardson-suspension-raskin-be3ce901-94dc-432a-ba4a-5f568cb0d1de.html;Left politicians and activists are crying racism because a black female athlete is getting disqualified from the Olympics for knowingly breaking a rule for her sport, implying that she would not have been disciplined if she was white. These activists hold up Michael Phelps as evidence, stating that he didn’t face any consequences for smoking weed. However, as Snopes points out in its fact check of this claim, Phelps never tested positive for THC/marijuana, but was photographed smoking marijuana. And even then, although Phelps never failed an athletic drug test, he was still suspended from USA Swimming for 3 months in 2009. Lance Armstrong had 7 Tour de France medals revoked for failing a drug test. So to argue that holding Sha’Carri Richardson to the same standards as all other athletes—a standard she consented to by virtue of competing as a professional athlete—is racist, or that white athletes get a pass when she did not, is simply untrue. Those arguing for her to be reinstated to the US Olympic Team are basically using an erroneous claim of racism to give afford her special treatment. If a white athlete were in the same position, disqualified from the Olympics for failing a marijuana test, activists would not be coming to his or her (especially his) defense. That white athlete would simply quietly face the consequences. The reasonableness of the rules is not important. It doesn’t matter whether a ban on marijuana makes sense in track and field. What matters is that all competitors agreed to follow that rule, and when a black female athlete did not, activists screamed that she should be exempt from the rule. ;;2021-07-08;https://www.axios.com/pfizer-fda-third-coronavirus-vaccine-dose-afab8eb5-e2a6-4dbd-92b7-d642528b960e.html;Pfizer is seeking FDA approval for administering another dose of its supposedly perfectly safe mRNA coronavirus vaccine. If Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine is so safe, and already approved for two doses, why does the company need further approval to administer an extra dose?

This should raise concern to anyone with a rational view on assessing the risks of medical treatment. ;;2021-07-08;https://www.axios.com/harris-dnc-25-million-investment-voting-rights-52c733a0-be54-46c8-96a9-0438902125ed.html;The Democrats, which (as a political party) will naturally seek all possible advantages in an election, has announced that it will invest $25 million in securing increased “voting access” for Americans.

One stated purpose of the funding is to counter “legal challenges” to election results, challenges which are the legal right of ALL parties and candidates in an election. This funding from the DNC would be like one sports team investing in hiring good referees for their games.

Although this case rate represents only less than one one-hundredth of one percent of all fully vaccinated Illinois residents, it proves that the claim of 100% effectiveness against “severe” cases is utterly false. ;;Moreover, this calculation is the percent of all fully vaccinated Illinoisans who were hospitalized for COVID: the percent of fully vaccinated Illinoisans who were EXPOSED to COVID an then hospitalized is likely significantly higher (i.e. not all fully vaccinated Illinoisans were exposed to COVID and thus had the efficacy of their vaccinations tested). Illinois currently has a COVID case rate of 1.5% (as of this writing). Vaccinated individuals obviously contract COVID at a lower rate than unvaccinated individuals, since the former’s immunity means that a higher viral load is required for them to develop a full-on case (instead of the immune system quickly neutralizing the intruder). But to make a conservative estimate, let’s assume that the case rate for vaccinated people is as high as that of unvaccinated people, as this will produce a larger population of estimated infected vaccinated individuals and thus a lower percentage of severe cases (and remember: vaccinated people are less likely to get tested in the first place, so the 1.5% figure is made up mostly of unvaccinated people). As of this writing, there are 5,917,735 fully vaccinated Illinois residents. At an infection rate of 1.5%, this would mean that there are an estimated 88,766 vaccinated Illinoisans who still contracted COVID. If you take 518 severe cases among vaccinated people and divide by 88,766 this comes out to a 5.8% rate of fully vaccinated Illinoisans contracting such a serious case of COVID that they will be hospitalized. That is greater than 1 in 20.
2021-07-09;https://twitter.com/sunraysunray/status/1413478504650346496;A woke academic is proposing a new amendment to the US constitution that would create a department with supervisory power over the entire federal government, to ensure that it complies with the department’s view of acceptable speech. This is the spitting image of authoritarianism: setting up a council that it able to control all speech by all government officials, which would have the undeniable effect of controlling the government entirely. Authoritarian is the total submission to the will of one political faction, enforced swiftly, aggressively, and and mercilessly by the power of the state. A board that can censor or punish any government official (elected or unelected) who deviates from this department’s view of what is acceptable, which is inherently an arbitrary determination, would manifest precisely this kind of authoritarian control. Any view which requires state coercion and repression to realize should be inherently suspect—if the Woke movement was truly just in a way that was evident to all via rational argument, why would they need the federal government to force everyone to comply with it?

When Trump used the office of the presidency to enrich his family, a vocal wing of congressional Democrats pursued using the emoluments clause to impeach him. Yet when Biden does the same thing (which, of course, should be condemned regardless of a politician’s party), there is of course no discussion among Democrats of an ethics investigation, much less impeachment on the grounds of violating the emoluments clause. For the nth time, Democrats prove they have no intention of following the ethical strictures they set down for everyone else to follow. 
2021-07-11;https://twitter.com/ZTPetrizzo/status/1414202890307186694;A left-allied journalist publicly suggested that the FBI jail all Capitol Riot participants, even those who have not been charged with a crime, while the FBI investigates them. This is pure authoritarianism. Our constitution guarantees that citizens may not be held unless they are formally charged with a crime. It it is not enough merely to be under investigation—only when law enforcement has probable cause to believe that an individual has committed a crime may they apprehend that individual. To erode this freedom merely out of resentment at the politically motivated riot of another faction is reckless, as it sets a precedent by which the government can lock up anyone on the government’s faintest suggestion that that person engaged in criminal activity. In other words, because the government can initiate an investigation with no oversight, if an investigation by itself is sufficient to arrest someone, the government could just “investigate” someone and then immediately imprison them, with no judicial oversight. Those who serve the Democrats are apparently so irate at the thought of any Capitol Rioter escaping punishment that they want to hand the government authoritarian security state powers.

The radical left basically implied that black people who don’t agree with them are too stupid to see that they (the radical left) are correct—that black people are too stupid to know how to identify and secure their own needs in their own community. To the left, black people couldn’t possibly support the police unless they were being tricked or manipulated. Quite to the contrary, it’s the left that is using black people to advance it’s radical police abolition agenda, making this a classic case of psychological projection (falsely diagnosing in others what is present in oneself). This is more proof that there is no faction more racist than the political left. They don’t care about what  racial minorities actually want, or what is truly best for people with these backgrounds and experiences. They simply advance the false narrative that all nonwhite individuals are on their side, and that therefor they have the clout to act in these individuals’ names in whatever manner they choose.

Democrats love to extol the sacred virtues of allowing the democratic process to play out unobstructed until it leads to policies they don’t like: then they feel justified in using any tactic at their disposal, no matter how hypocritical, to advance their own aims. These Texas Democrats proved as much: they are obstructing the business of their duly elected peers in the majority, in just the same way that they argue the filibuster does, by preventing a quorum through their willful—and illegal—failure to appear in their legislative chamber for session. The cognitive dissonance and hypocrisy of opposing the filibuster because it thwarts an elected majority and depriving their legislature of a quorum to thwart an elected majority is inescapable. And of course, if the shoe was on the other foot, the Democrats would be crying bloody murder: if California Republicans fled the state to prevent the passage of stricter gun laws, the Democrats would instantly and vehemently condemn it, and likely marshal all law enforcement powers at their disposal to compel the truant representatives to appear. 
2021-07-14;https://twitter.com/JerryDunleavy/status/1415300795067768832;In spite of how much the left insists that Americans hate the police and want them dismantled, a new Gallup poll shows that of all the societal institutions Americans were surveyed on, the police was the only one that people expressed MORE confidence in this year as compared to last. In the interest of full transparency, the increase of confidence in the police was minor, at only 3%, and is within 2 points of its score two years ago. But when accounting for the margin of error, this shows that support for the police is essentially unchanged, and hovers at around half of American adults. However, this is just one’s confidence expressed when prompted by a pollster. Given the present cultural/political climate, it’s not unreasonable to expect support to actually be higher, since one may be more likely to express disapproval to support the present cultural narrative when one truly approves than the reverse. And this number might be higher still if more Americans had more dealings with police in which they received the police’s help. It’s easy to look down on police when your life and property are safe and you never have any interaction with them. But as soon as you need their help, your views may well be more positive.

Like any competent grifter, she expressed that it’s not enough to attend just one of her $25,000 workshops, but that you must continue to attend them to have any hope of salvation (from being a racist). But, of course, in her teachings, white people can never not be racist no matter how hard they try, leaving them no choice but to continue attending workshops like hers (lining her pockets) forever so they can constantly atone for their racist sins. She sells her leftist guilt racket by giving an affected account of how she believes she has lengthened the life of a black person by one hour because of how hard she worked to be an anti-racist. Ensuring that you treat all people of all races with respect is obviously important, but the con job of people like DiAngelo is so transparent, and yet the left continues to shell out for more wisdom from the anti-racist prophet.

Their ideas on anti-racism could not have been produced without CRT. If their cause is truly beyond reproach, if there is absolutely nothing sinister about CRT, then why is the left working so hard to sever any ties between CRT and anti-racism (the latter of which is much more accepted in mainstream discourse and culture)? Are they ashamed of CRT? Of course they are, because no one who didn’t have something to hide would act as they do.
2021-07-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1415690784444227587;A tweet from the American Booksellers’ Association, which it since removed, apologized for committing “violence” by selling a book that a vocal segment of people deemed to be racist. That a major trade group is solidifying this precedent of equating speech with violence is extremely dangerous, because not only does it (a) lower the threshold for the escalation of a confrontation to physical violence but (b) speech is inherently more subjective in interpretation than physical blows. There is rarely any confusion surrounding when one is struck with force and when one is not. However, what one person perceives the meaning of words to be, colored by connotations and experiences that may be unique to them, may differ wildly from what another does. If speech can be violence, and the hearer determines the content of another’s speech, then we have given everyone (and anyone) the power to declare arbitrarily when violence has been done to them. This plays right into the radical left’s hands, as they desperately seek a pretext to visit violence upon their political opponents. 
2021-07-15;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1415725320381079569;The Biden administration admitted that it directed Facebook on what kind of content to censor on its platform, with which Facebook willingly complied—the government carried out censorship by proxy, laundering their censorship through the private sector to attempt to skirt constitutional protections on speech. This is an existential threat to the fabric of civil society. It cannot be overstated how dangerous it is to normalize government censorship, regardless of the means by which they carry it out. If Facebook policed its platform completely on its own initiative, that would be one thing, and courts have upheld their right to do exactly that. But when the government gets involved in telling Facebook who and what to remove, this is government censorship. The government, controlled by Biden and the Democrats, is trying to obfuscate its censorship, so that it can truthfully say that it did not carry out the deed, and that it took place on a private platform. However, courts have ruled that such circuitous means of censoring is unconstitutional because the government is still the author of the impulse to censor. Additionally, there is the implicit threat of coercive action or retaliation by the government had Facebook not complied, not only by nature of its power to do so (via trade laws) but by virtue of FCC Chariwoman Khan’s stated intention to pursue an anti-trust investigation against Facebook (among others).

This rhetoric not only distorts the reality of threats to Americans’ safety and liberty and recklessly injects greater divisiveness into our public discourse, but sets an alarming precedent. If the left acts on this statement, taking it as literally true, then they will be able to justify the suppression of dissent against the left by all means necessary, including through the state wielding force against Republicans. If Republicans are, in the left’s view, more dangerous than ISIS or the CCP, what means would not be justified in neutralizing them? If America can send special forces soldiers and drones after ISIS, and Republicans are supposedly a greater threat than that, what’s to stop the Democrats from using these tools against Republicans? Ideas like this open the door to a truly terrifying deterioration of American democracy into tyranny the likes of which we have not seen in our darkest moments as a country—perhaps, given the tools at the US government’s disposal, the likes of which no country on Earth has ever seen.

The COVID pandemic has been such a profit, PR, and R&D boon to Pfizer that any organization funded by them should not be trusted to dispense unbiased, factual guidance on public health or medicine. Anything Pfizer had a hand in should be doubly subject to skepticism, considering they were the first COVID vaccine manufacturer to brazenly propose the money grab of advocating third doses of the vaccine. Based on its behavior, it is clear that Pfizer is shamelessly motivated by profit, and is willing to say and do anything in service of maximizing it. The fact that figures on the left are not entertaining the possibility of bias shows just how much of a culture war battlefield the vaccine has become, relegating all concerns of society-wide health outcomes to secondary concern.

The claims she made are assessed point by point as follows. (1) The vaccines are “controversial” whether or not one agrees that they should be regarded as such. (2) Describing 2019-SARS-CoV-2 as “not dangerous for non-obese people and those under 65” is somewhat subjective. It is not literally true that it poses a 0% chance of danger for those under age 65 and not obese, since there is a small but definite chance that COVID can kill anyone. But IS true that the chances of dying from COVID are exceptionally small for those under 65 and those who are not obese. It would be more accurate to say “individuals with few or no co-morbidities” than “non-obese people”, since there are other co-morbidities besides obesity that increase risk of death from COVID. However, when considering this amended statement—“COVID is not dangerous for people under 65 and with few to no co-morbidities”—a reasonable person could say this statement is true, since individuals in these demographics have a greater than 99% chance of surviving COVID. (3) It is factually accurate to say that there are about 6000 deaths RELATED to the COVID vaccines, as reported in the VAERS database, a repository of vaccine side effect reports that is almost universally viewed by the medical community as credible and trustworthy. This is not to say that these 6000 deaths were CAUSED by the vaccine—neither VAERS nor Greene are making this claim—but that there is a relation (a correlation, to be exact) between them. More research must be conducted to determine if this link is causal or not, but the relation cannot be denied. (4) Yes, concerning side effects have been reported—these are the same reports that comprise the 6000 deaths figure. VAERS collects reports of side effects, whether fatal or not, and has in fact received reports of non-fatal adverse side effects. This point cannot be factually disputed. (5) To argue that vaccines should be optional is a statement of opinion, not fact. Even so, it is an opinion that should hardly be viewed as controversial or unfounded. Given that most of the claims Greene made are reasonable, it would seem that Twitter’s suspension of her account based on this tweet is an act of pure censorship. If other tweets of hers merited suspension, that is a separate matter. But to penalize her for this one is censorship.
2021-07-23;https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-to-strip-social-media-of-protections-for-health-misinformation-11626976800;The US government is proposing legislation that would rescind legal protection for social media platforms that do not carry out the US government’s desired censorship of information regarding COVID and the COVID vaccines. Under Section 230 of the CDA, online service providers (including, notably, social media companies) are protected from legal liability for content posted by users as long as these providers act promptly to remove illegal content on their service when such content is brought to their attention. Section 230 has proven vitally important to the growth of the Internet: before its passage, companies either chose to implement no content moderation, or such strict content moderation as to be onerous to users. Holding the suspension of Section 230’s protection over social media companies that don’t censor information that contradicts the government’s chosen narrative on COVID is basically a threat of expensive legal retaliation. Threats such as this to compel a private actor to carry out government censorship is exactly the kind of unconstitutional behavior that Greenwald (who is trained as a lawyer) forewarned, citing key court rulings in support of this view. Should it be passed, this bill would go one step further in cementing a dangerous precedent allowing censorship in which the government coerces private companies to act in its name. This would merely introduce a single, minimal intermediate step in censorship where the government is barred from doing so directly—exactly the rationale behind the court rulings deeming this behavior unconstitutional. 
2021-07-23;https://twitter.com/kerpen/status/1418562741246300167;Data from the UK on infection of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV2 indicate that, depending on the demographic, those who have 2 doses of an mRNA vaccine are no more protected against contracting COVID or dying from it than those who are unvaccinated. Data shows that more vaccinated individuals over 50 are contracting COVID from the Delta variant than unvaccinated individuals over 50. And for those under 50, the fatality rate is the same regardless of whether an individual is vaccinated or not. This is in lien with what mRNA vaccine inventor Dr. Robert Malone cautioned: it is unwise to vaccinate DURING a pandemic, because it only accelerates the rate of mutation so that the virus will avoid antibodies induced by vaccination.

Americans have a right to know the effectiveness of vaccines which the government approved under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) under the extraordinary circumstances posed by the COVID pandemic. That the Biden administration would explicitly deny this request is the height of contempt for the American people. It’s a disgrace to the trust the public has placed in them. More to the point, it is highly suspect behavior. If the vaccines are so effective, publishing the data on the rate of breakthrough infections should be low, and should only bolster the case for the vaccine’s safety. If the Democrats’ narrative—that everyone should vaccinate—is true, then there’s no reason not to publish the data. So the fact that they don’t want to means that the data would blow a hole in their narrative. 
2021-07-25;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1419366715729891333;While the left screams about how the police are racist, a poll of Detroit residents indicated that the top concern for black residents was keeping their community safe from rising rates of crime. 24% of black residents (nearly 1 in 4) listed public safety as a concern, whereas only 3% of them listed police reform as a concern. It appears that black residents make a direct association between public safety and allowing police to operate. On the other hand, more white residents voiced concern for police reform (12%) than public safety (10%). This is yet another data point indicating that it is the left that is the racist faction, not the right. White leftists (the majority of leftists, just as the majority of Americans are white) don’t care that the people they are supposedly fighting for, racial minorities, do not want to the defunding, much less elimination, of the police. Predominantly white leftists are using racial minorities as a political prop to justify and obtain their preferred policy outcome—they are treating individuals of racial minority background not as people, with their own complex network of needs, but as a thing to be manipulated. And if the left secures the abolition of police, it is racial minority communities (which, it should be noted, are segregated in cities run by left politicians) who will pay the highest price when crime spikes and devastates their communities. Affluent liberals will procure private security, observing no diminution of their quality of life, while their African-American and Latin-American neighbors will stand to lose everything: their property, their hope, and their lives. Why do leftists want to abolish police so badly? Most of the rank and file who meekly submit to the woke dogma handed down probably earnestly believe the absurd propaganda that less police will produce safer racial minority neighborhoods. Some cynical aristocrats on the left probably see themselves saving a buck by trading taxpayer-funded police, who mostly defend everyone else, for privately funded police who mostly defend them. The hardcore leftists simply want to clear the field for their violent socialist/communist revolution. It’s much easier to take over the government when there aren’t cops to put down the uprising.

In the context of woke politics, which the ACLU has demonstrated by its recent social media output that it fully inhabits, “racist” means that something is irredeemably a tool of “oppression”, leaving its abolition as the only acceptable course of action. In our political discourse today, “racist” is taken as the ultimate refutation, a condemnation for demolition. Of all the amendments, the First and Second are the most central to the classical liberal society that the Founding Fathers rooted our nation in: the First Amendment allowed the unfettered discourse to carry out democratic debate and accountability, and the Second reserved a safeguard against the insidious threat of tyranny. Without the Second Amendment, citizens are at the mercy of the violent mob, unable to defend their lives, property, and freedom. That an organization that was once a bulwark of liberty has now declared war on the Second Amendment shows that Americans are in true peril of losing their rights. The only threat more dire than the government unilaterally suspending civil rights is the body of citizens willingly relinquishing them—sadly, where the ACLU intends to lead, many will follow.

It is impossible to overstate how wildly reckless statements like this are. It would be one thing to label the actual participants of the Capitol Riot as enemies of the state, even though this would be dangerous hyperbole as well considering what a minimal threat to the nation’s stability they posed by mostly milling around the Capitol. But to extend this designation to all voters, present at the Capitol Riot or not, of a duly elected president as traitors is the height of authoritarianism. Such rhetoric is nothing less than a pretext for the suppression of the ruling party’s political opponents (namely, the Democrats’). Using the actions of a few (and blowing them completely out of proportions at that, deplorable as they were) to allow for suppressing the whole is the very essence of tyranny. This may be a nominally unaligned journalist advocating this, but they are expressing views that are shared by many on the left—it would appear, from the way that the 1/6 commission is being conducted, that Democrats, themselves, agree. And, of course, this proxy for the Democrats isn’t stopping at Republican voters. She has chosen to target the Republican party itself. Declarations like this capture the Democratic Party’s apparent desire to disband the Republican Party and establish a one-party state (third-parties will, I would imagine, not be allowed to fill the void left by the GOP). One-party states are uniformly authoritarian ones. 
2021-07-27;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1420076714575765510;Lagging vaccination rates in populations that tend to the political right incur the derision of the Democrats, but equally low (if not lower) vaccination rates in primarily Democrat-voting inner-city African-Americans incurs substantially less criticism from Democrats. If Democrats’ policy and public statements regarding COVID were truly guided by public health first and foremost, they would criticize every demographic group with low vaccine uptake. But this discrepancy reveals that Democrats, like with everything they do, use COVID to score political points first, and protect Americans second. Because they have built their entire electoral strategy around identity politics, they know they can’t afford to speak ill of black people in any way. The ironic thing is that, if the vaccines are truly safe and effective, this attitude would actually lead to greater harm to black people—Democrats should want to encourage higher vaccination among black people, but would rather just ignore the issue so they don’t lose votes. In other words, Democrats would rather let black people die than anger them and lose votes. This is yet further evidence that there is no more racist of a group of people than the left.
2021-07-27;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1420084207318093825;A leftist on TikTok gave away the game, outright admitting that people with a non-binary gender identity (and, in her case, even women) use gender identity to win concessions from society and other people: “gender is a tool to get what I want”. The fact that a person’s gender identity is self-assigned plus woke devotees’ demands that certain identities get special treatment is a recipe for abuse. If you can call yourself whatever gender you want, and woke people lavish praise and special treatment on you for having a gender that’s not “man” or “woman”, why wouldn’t you choose non-binary gender identity? It doesn’t even require you to change your behavior or appearance in any way: simply declare your new identity and begin enjoying your newfound social privileges. This option, of course, is extremely attractive to self-entitled narcissists, since it obligates everyone give them special privileges. These privileges are not just socially enforced by the woke zealots, but in the law, as it is considered a “hate crime” not to use someone’s preferred pronouns. So, someone can think of themselves as a woman (or as nothing in particular at all), publicly state a non-binary identity and pronouns, and then force people to use those pronouns under penalty of criminal charges. And like with so many social issue, this supposedly progressive belief actually hurts people who are truly marginalized by their identity. Until 2015, gays and lesbians were legally barred from marrying the people they loved—that is real injustice the likes of which the fad-chasing non-binary person will never understand. To self-identify as non-binary on a whim, to manipulate those around them into giving them special treatment, is a slap in the face to the gay and lesbian communities. 
2021-07-27;https://www.axios.com/capitol-riot-terrorists-christians-police-attack-c5c8938d-939a-42cc-bcc6-273d91143bb6.html;A DC Metro police officer who was controlling the crowd at the Capitol Riot labeled the rioters, who were not armed and killed no one, as “terrorists”. As a law enforcement officer in the nation’s capital, this individual knows that designating someone as a terrorist unlocks military-grade surveillance and suspension of civil liberties as legally permissible means of neutralizing the threat posed by that person. In essence, it gives law enforcement license to treat an individual so-designated as a military rather than a civilian target. To hear this term applied to hundreds of Americans is unsettling for two reasons. One, these Americans, though law-breakers who should be punished to the furthest extent that the law provides, did not commit any deeds that rise to the level of terrorism. They did not kill anyone (at most they left some police officers with a few bruises and broken bones), they weren’t armed, they committed extremely minor property damage (when they could have easily desecrated our nation’s most treasured historical artifacts and symbols), and many of them left of the Capitol Building of their own accord after mere hours. Two, categorizing Americans residing on American soil as terrorists will now target them with the full and merciless might of the US security state, and sets a precedent for the government to do so to any American. The sealed legal barrier has been broken: where once terrorists were foreigners whose organizations resided abroad, now anyone can be deemed a terrorist for as minor of an infraction as trespassing on federal property. Thanks to the Democrats’ pathological obsession with crushing the Republican voters who dared dissent, now the government has a legal basis for aiming military-grade surveillance at, and suspending the rights of, anyone accused of breaking federal law. In fact, most of those deemed “terrorists” have not even gone on trial yet, so this designation threatens the integrity of the criminal justice system.

These 50,000 people attempted to cross into the US without proper legal authorization, were detained, and were then let go into the US with no court date set. How can any reasonable person think this makes sense? When  a court date is set, most of them will not appear in court. Why would they? While some of them likely believe they have a strong asylum case, the rest know they do not and so flee into the country instead of risking a loss in court. Worse, this will simply inspire more people with no valid asylum claims to cross into the US. If they know they will get released into the US and can just skip court, it’s no different than if they crossed into the US and never got caught: either way they have broken the law, the maximum penalty of which is deportation. But now they know that if they’re caught, they can still live in the US.
2021-07-27;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/07/cdc-mask-reversal-vaccinated-should-wear-masks-in-many-settings-amid-surge/;The CDC has now been forced to admit not only that vaccinated individuals can still contract and transmit COVID, but consequently that the vaccines are not as effective as advertised, as evidenced by its new guidance that vaccinated people should resume wearing masks. The CDC claims that earlier variants couldn’t be transmitted by vaccinated people and that the Delta variant can, but this is at odds with basic science. Any vaccine of any type does not prevent a vaccinated individual from contracting a disease. It merely prepares the individual’s immune system to better combat the virus, so that infections are shorter and milder. That a person doesn’t experience symptoms does not mean they did not contract the disease—it may be that their infection was so short-lived because of aggressive immune response that the infection could not progress to the point of inducing symptoms. What is more likely the case now is that the Delta variant infects vaccinated individuals long enough to be spread to others, since the Delta variant is better at evading the vaccinated body’s immune response. Let’s assume the complete competence and political neutrality of the CDC for the sake of argument. It would not make sense for the CDC to advise vaccinated people to wear masks unless they thought (a) that masks were effective at stopping spread and (b) that vaccinated people could spread COVID. Conversely, the CDC would not have issued its prior guidance that vaccinated individuals do not need to wear masks in public if they believed, at that time, that vaccinated people could spread COVID—even spreading COVID among other vaccinated people would be dangerous, as they could then subsequently come into contact with an unvaccinated person. The fact that guidance changed from no masks to masks for the vaccinated proves that the CDC was wrong about spread by vaccinated people. But by logical extension, this also reinforces the emerging data that the vaccines are not as effective as advertised. As noted earlier, data out of the UK is showing that the vaccinated are no less likely than the unvaccinated under 50 to die from COVID, and that the chance of hospitalization is barely lower for the vaccinated vs. the unvaccinated in this age group. The whole point of a vaccine is to lower one’s chances of hospitalization or death. In that regard, the vaccine still lowers the death rate for those over 50. But for those under 50, the vaccine provides very little benefit. And all of this data is only for a variant that has emerged less than 6 months after the US (and many Western European countries) approached its vaccination target. Future variants may render the vaccine completely ineffective. 
2021-07-27;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o18Zs9dTXc;It is the left that is racist against black people, as they obsessively advance this narrative that black people are only helpless victims and that they couldn’t possibly rise above their circumstances. As a black host of a sports commentary show pointed out, the only African-American narrative the left acknowledges or permits is that African-Americans have been put down and rendered completely supine in the face of racial prejudice. The left disavows narratives of black people overcoming prejudice to excel, nor the end of racial prejudice and black Americans becoming equal inheritors of this country, its freedoms, its values, and its prosperity. The host articulated an important related point: that the left teaches African-Americans that they should hate the country, and should feel no shame in taking advantage of whatever benefits they can extract from America. In his view, these ideas are encapsulated in Simone Biles’ withdrawal from the Olympics: had she felt a sense of pride in and duty toward the US, she would not have stepped down from the Team USA, who was counting on her to help  propel them to victory on the world stage. She and those of like mind, he contends, have no sense of pride that she, as an African-American woman, has the opportunity to show the world the results of America’s fulfilled vision of equality. She has no pride, he asserts, that she represents a country that freed its enslaved population and gave them the chance to take equal part in the freest country in the world. Instead, black athletes will attach themselves to the US when it suits them, and abandon it when it no longer does. In withdrawing, Biles said she had her medals and so didn’t need any more, giving no thought to teammates for whom she would be instrumental in them obtaining their first/only medals. It is hard to think of anything less principled for an athlete to do to their fellow teammates. And on top of that, in forsaking her team and her country, Biles was lauded for prioritizing her mental health, as though it was ridiculous to expect an athlete to endure stress. By virtue of being an Olympic athlete, which is something you voluntarily consent to do, you now have a duty to your team and your country, with all the stress that that entails. If you don’t want that pressure, you shouldn’t sign up to be an Olympian. But once you are one, you can’t just walk away. 
2021-07-28;https://www.axios.com/cdc-fully-vaccinated-covid-test-exposure-2369e3d4-05b8-412e-b1c1-7f432ccc5c16.html;CDC is also advising that vaccinated people get tested for COVID even if they show no symptoms, further proving that the CDC was wrong that vaccinated people are essentially safe from COVID. Before this new guidance, the CDC’s position (as inferred from its guidance) was that vaccinated people should not worry about getting COVID, because even if they got it, they couldn’t transmit it and it wouldn’t hospitalize them. Their recommendation to the vaccinated to wear masks and get tested proves they were wrong about transmission from vaccinated individuals. And the CDC doesn’t appear to want to know if it’s right or wrong about the vaccine’s protection from hospitalization and death from COVID, since it doesn’t track “breakthrough infections” (infections of those vaccinated against COVID) in any meaningful way. How is that even remotely possible? Any rational person would agree that it is the CDC’s job to track this metric, and yet they don’t. Either the CDC is grossly incompetent, or they are consciously trying to hide something by not collecting it in the first place (you can’t FOIA for documents that don’t exist). 
2021-07-29;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1420821256807534597;A prominent group of socialists, who generally profess to be against repressive state authority, have come out as being pro-FBI in its hunt for supposed right-wing extremists (which is basically anyone right of center). The supreme irony is that the FBI ‘s political repression operations have historically primarily targeted the left in general and socialists in particular. This is more proof that the left has no principles, but are willing to untether state power from any restrictions and invoke it to destroy their political opponents, regardless of the long-term consequences. They don’t care that this sets the precedent for state security to spy on people and round them up for nonviolent federal offenses (e.g. trespassing, property destruction). The left has shown its authoritarian colors. 
2021-07-30;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421186558661693447;A KFF poll shows that 1 in 3 black adults, essential workers, and political independents are resistant to getting the vaccine, compared with 2 in 5 who identify as Republicans, showing that the partisan narrative of “vaccine hesitancy” advanced by the left has no merit. If the left were truly concerned about getting people vaccinated, they would be imploring all of these groups to get vaccinated. Instead, they only chastise Republicans, painting a picture that it is only Republicans that are not contributing to herd immunity by getting vaccinated. Far from it, Trump and nearly every Republican governor has publicly advocated that citizens get vaccinated. In fact, if we assume the left’s noble and non-partisan intentions, not only is it unfair to only criticize the right, but it’s even more concerning that they ignore the low vaccine uptake in the black community. If they cared about black lives—the left, of course, asserts unequivocally that black lives matter—they would work harder to get them vaccinated. The truth, though, is that the left doesn’t really care about black people, but simply use them as a political prop. 
2021-07-30;https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/partner_surveys/crosstabs_npa_july_16_18_2021;A new poll of American adults shows that while only 49% of likely voters believe that congress should investigate the Capitol Riot, 66% of likely voters believe that congress should investigate the riots that occurred during the George Floyd protests. The fact that congressional Democrats ascribe so much more importance to the Capitol Riot and have barely even condemned the George Floyd riots shows that the Democrats have no interest in executing the will of the American people, but only in decimating their political opponents. In fact, the George Floyd riots had a much more destructive impact on racial minorities and poor neighborhoods, as black-owned businesses were set ablaze in the frenzy. If the Democrats truly cared about black people, as they routinely and loudly profess, they would investigate the riots vigorously. So why don’t they? The answer is likely that they know that it will undermine their cause. It is probably the case that an investigation would uncover just how active and violent Antifa was during the riots, undermining the legitimacy of the Black Lives Matter movement. It would expose how saturated with communists and anarchists the woke movement is, vindicating the Republican narrative that the Democrats enable these groups (which, in giving them political cover as they are doing by not investigating the riots, is technically true). 
2021-07-30;https://twitter.com/DPJHodges/status/1419027385169719300;A journalist who writes for a prominent UK publication openly advocated for the arrest of unvaccinated people for the crime of choosing not to inject an experimental gene therapy into their bodies. The hardline authoritarian left rhetoric was leading here, and now it has arrived. It’s hard to imagine something more authoritarian than the government telling you that you MUST consume an experimental pharmaceutical substance. The left counters that vaccines are required to attend school, but forget that home-schooling is an option, in which case vaccination is not required. There is no direct legal compulsion to be vaccinated anywhere in the US. To change that would be to irrevocably cross a dangerous Rubicon in which the government can make citizens take chemical substances under penalty of imprisonment. More tyrannical dystopias than this cannot be fathomed. Anyone who endorses this position cannot refute that they favor authoritarianism. And, of course, the left has been using vaccination as a convenient proxy for political affiliation, so that they can pretend they aren’t targeting Republicans. I’m sure the left would cheer on the prospect of imprisoning the right for standing up for their freedom of self-determination, as the nation’s Founders envisioned. It would be a safe bet that, if such a draconian policy were ever enacted, black people (who are unvaccinated at nearly the same rate as Republican voters) would escape the mass arrests.
2021-07-30;https://twitter.com/SteveInmanUIC/status/1421152444566835203;Video has resurfaced from 2020 showing Pelosi advocating against vaccine mandates. She stressed that it would be unacceptable to demand anyone disclose their vaccination status, that this was a matter of one’s legally protected private health information. Of course, it was easy for her to advocate this when Trump was pushing the vaccine, and therefore the Democrats against the vaccine. But now that the Democrats have seized the helm of the vaccine narrative, she is not pushing back when, for instance, New York City’s Democrat mayor announced a vaccine mandate to enter any private establishment in the city. Once again, this proves the Democrats stand for nothing but themselves. They will embrace principles of privacy and personal liberty when it suits them, and abandon them when they no longer do. Worst of all, the Democrats’ unquestioningly loyal supporters raised no concern at the abandonment of these ideals: they simply nod along and parrot the new talking points, lest the Republicans score any political victories. 
2021-07-31;https://twitter.com/TimRunsHisMouth/status/1370570819600977922;Democrats pitch a fit at the idea of having to show ID to vote, but think nothing of requiring citizens to show certificates of having injected a gene therapy in order to go to any non-public area outside one’s own home. Not only is voting not as vital to a normal citizen’s everyday functioning, but citizens can already be reasonably expected to have an ID (which, of course, does not require the injection of a substance into the body). You need an ID to have a job, rent an apartment, drive, receive welfare benefits, and make use of many other important functions, so unless an individual somehow doesn’t do any of these things, it is almost certain that they have an ID. However, there are innumerable valid reasons for not wanting the COVID “vaccine” (which, again, is actually gene therapy). Many people have religious or moral objections to it, such as that it was researched through the use of embryonic stem cells. Other people are disinclined to take it because they already had COVID, and thus have natural immunity—studies appear to indicate that natural immunity and vaccine immunity are roughly the same, and that an individual who who has had COVID does not measurably decrease their risk of re-infection by also vaccinating. Children should also not be expected to get vaccinated, since their case and mortality rates are so low that the vaccine would produce negligible benefit for moderate risk (of side effects). But the fact that Democrats can embrace these two antithetical positions shows what hypocrites they are, and bent on controlling people they are. 
2021-07-31;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1421509635731869699;Major media figures at CNN openly advocated denying access to the workplace and grocery stories to unvaccinated people, to coerce them into getting vaccinated. Americans have a right to choose what substances to put into their bodies, so to deny them access to employment and food is brazenly coercive. Such coercion loses its legitimacy considering that emerging data on the Delta variant shows that the vaccine barely reduces the chance of hospitalization and doesn’t reduce the chance of death for the vaccinated under age 50. The CDC is beginning to accept the data now that they are cautioning that the vaccinated can spread the Delta variant at the same rate as the unvaccinated (which also suggests that vaccinated and unvaccinated people get infected at similar rates). And of course, there’s also the fact that the mortality rate from COVID is about as low as the flu. Taken together, the government has no business shutting the unvaccinated out of society—if this were an ebola pandemic, the government would have much more reasonable grounds for pushing aggressively for vaccination, but it’s not, and the vaccines are beginning to prove minimally effective. If the Delta is this resistant to the vaccine after less than 6 months, what assurance do we have that in 6 more months a new variant that totally sidesteps the vaccine won’t emerge?
2021-08-01;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-58045787;YouTube has censored a news outlet’s account for discussing the possibility of using ivermectin as a COVID treatment. There is no evidence that ivermectin is a dangerous drug. Quite the contrary, it has been deemed safe and effective for decades, passing tests widely recognized by the medical field. In fact, its safety profile is higher than that of the mRNA vaccines for which advocacy is not censored. How can social media justify censoring this information, especially now that the CDC has acknowledged that vaccinated individuals can still contract COVID? Wouldn’t a vaccinated person who nevertheless gets sick with COVID want to be aware of treatment options? There is currently no alternative treatments with clinical trials as effective as those with ivermectin have proven. The only reason that remains for why social media would elect to censor is that they are committed tot he vaccine narrative, because their Democrat allies are. At a minimum, the left has made vaccines a front in the culture war, so they stand to lose a lot if it is proven to be inferior to alternatives.

How does any rational person justify one leader breaking the law to provide a social safety net (Biden extending the eviction moratorium by legally shaky executive order), but not another doing the same thing (Trump pushing for a stimulus payment on legally tenuous grounds)? That’s rhetorical, because clearly the people who do this are irrational, or at least unprincipled. If this isn’t proof that the press and Democrats are directly allied, then nothing does. 
2021-08-05;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1423286265722646528;Left-wing Democrat Cori Bush defended her prerogative to expand her security team and then, literally in the same breath, proceeded to advocate for defunding the police—she basically spit in her constituents’ faces, stating that she deserves security but they don’t. These two beliefs are completely incoherent, but it illustrates how self-centered Democrats are. It doesn’t matter to leftists like Bush that polling (such as that conducted recently in New York) shows that inner-city black people, the kinds of people she claims to stand for, are most concerned with rising crime rates than police brutality. What’s more important is the virtue signaling it permits elected Democrats like her to engage in. The Democrats are more concerned with rhetoric over meeting the needs of their constituents. Unfortunately, when people in these districts realize this, it will be too late: they will have already been  ravaged by violent crime.

A fair assessment of their actions would describe the Capitol rioters as a frenzied, mildly violent mob of trespassers on federal property. In condemning the Capitol rioters, the judge cited the deaths that occurred in connection with the incident but, of course, did not clarify that the deaths that took place in the Capitol Building on that day were all rioters, and not law enforcement officials, congress members or their staff, or any other innocent bystanders. This statement by a federal judge reinforces the dangerous precedent that the left is setting of designating their opponents as terrorists, so that higher-level law enforcement techniques, policies, and weapons can be deployed against them. It is dangerous enough when one branch of government does this, as congressional Democrats have done. With these latest remarks, though, figures in all three branches of government have classified the Capitol rioters, worthy of rebuke and criminal consequences though they certainly are, as terrorists. 
2021-08-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1424041786259935234;A left-wing civil society organization will be scanning PayPal for any transactions which it deems supportive of “hate”, “extremism”, or “anti-government” activities so that these users can be kicked off of one of the Internet’s biggest payment platforms. Of course, the ADL has left its definitions of these terms nebulous, ripe for radical interpretation and expansion so as to include anyone that does not share the ADL’s left-wing policy views. In essence, the ADL wants to ensure that the only people who can move money on PayPal are leftists and anyone willing to give way to leftist policy objectives and talking points (i.e. coward moderates willing to let the leftists do whatever they want). As Greenwald aptly points out, the partnership between the ADL and PayPal is just the latest in an effort across the left political sphere to make anyone who does not submit to their dogma a second-class citizen. Groups that are complicit in this effort cower behind the excuse that they aren’t using the government to impose these restrictions on personal freedoms, so it does not run afoul of the First Amendment. Though this may be so, it does fly in the face of the America’s Founders’ vision of a classically liberal society. It seems very doubtful that the Founders would have assented to the private sector perpetrating the very limitations on freedom that they barred the government from enacting. But there is a constitutional case that could be made: the private sector actors that are imposing the censorship of users in service of the current left-controlled government are doing so under the implicit threat of being regulated or broken up by that same government if they do not. What we are witnessing is the effect of a mutually reinforcing cycle. FEC disclosures show that Big Tech companies and their employees overwhelmingly donate to the Democrats—no rational person would ascribe this pattern to any other reason than that the Democrats are more willing to give these companies tax breaks and other corporate welfare. Big Tech donates to Democrats, Democrats funnel government money to Big Tech on the condition that Big Tech censors the Republicans and their supporters, this political suppression propels Democrats to electoral victories, where the Democrats can hand more money to Big Tech. And the cycle begins anew. It’s really as simple as that. 
2021-08-07;https://twitter.com/Rasmussen_Poll/status/1424052294010744836;A new poll from Rasmussen shows that a slight majority of American likely voters believe that cheating took place during the 2020 election (51%), and support an audit of the vote counts (55%). Moreover, 3 in 5 American likely voters believe that opponents of voter ID laws are trying to make cheating easier, and almost three quarters (74%) agree that requiring a photo ID to vote is a reasonable countermeasure against election fraud. These figures show just how fringe the Democrats’ anti-voter ID position is. To start with, every American regardless of political affiliation should want election audits, both in general and for 2020 in particular. The right does for obvious reasons: that there were irregularities in voting is undeniable, on account of the pandemic, but we still do not have a clear picture as to whether these irregularities affected the outcome of the election. And if Biden truly won fair and square, the left should welcome an audit since it would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Biden won. It’s suspicious, then, that this political faction is so vehemently against an audit. This new poll shows the insight that can be gained when divorcing policy debates from partisan positions. For the most part, public discourse on election integrity has been presented in a partisan context: when the public hears about voter ID laws, they immediately associate it with the Republicans proposing it, and associate the Democrats with the opposition to the proposal. Inevitably, most people fall back into their partisan camps before even assessing the merits of the policy. But when a polling company asks whether people support a measure, with no mention of the partisan alignment for or against it, common sense resumes. Because they are provided for very nominal fees by the government, and are needed for some of the most basic prerequisites of economic participation, it’s reasonable to expect someone to have an ID to vote. Strip parties away and people can clearly intuit that for themselves. But when the Democrats butt into this debate, they deploy the standard Woke identity politics nonsense and left-leaning voters snap back into line and away from common sense. But in reality, any party that wants to deliberately leave the door open to cheating, when closing it would be simple and exclude almost no voters, can’t be trusted.

The Democrats really aren’t fazed by the glaring hypocrisy of their actions, and then come up with the flimsiest grounds for dismissing any condemnation of their actions. Democrats cannot simultaneously say that the CDC is the emissary of “the science” that should be faithfully obeyed AND that they don’t need to observe CDC guidelines because they’re overly strict. But that’s essentially what they’re doing in Obama’s case. And of course, I challenge Democrats to find a critic of Obama’s birthday party who was dying to attend—it has nothing to do with jealousy and everything to do with publicizing hypocrisy by two-faced left political shills.

If this isn’t proof of how transparently self-serving the left’s calls for “justice” are, then there is probably nothing that will convince you. To the Democrats, treating sexual assault allegations credibly and with respect to the victim are only important if the accused isn’t a Democrat. But if the alleged Democrat perpetrator of sexual violence is of high enough political standing, then they will smear, intimidate, and traumatize as many victims as needed to keep that Democrat in power. The idea that Democrats care about sexual assault victims in the slightest should now be seen for the obvious and sick joke that it is. Anyone who seriously claims that Democrats care about sexual assault victims is a deluded, brainwashed thrall to the Party.
2021-08-09;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/08/09/kelvyn-park-high-school-throws-out-classic-books/;A high school in Chicago discarded multiple copies of dozens of of classic works of literature, suggesting that the Woke political regime has taken root even deeper in our education system. It is one thing for schools to throw out science textbooks, because new discoveries do change basic principles of biology, chemistry, physics, etc. from time to time. In some rare cases, new archaeological discoveries can even lead to changes in historical knowledge, which could lead those books to become obsolete. But defining works of Western literature, by their nature, should never become outmoded—there aren’t new versions of Dostoevsky or Shakespeare works that merit replacing old copies. The more likely explanation is that the school is jettisoning the works of “white” authors to make room for the radical Woke agenda. The Woke movement can’t stand the fact that artists of European descent had a large cultural influence in the Western world, and so they are trying to remold Western culture to exude their preferred political narrative. 
2021-08-10;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1425080785636311054;The media tries to keep up the facade that it is holding the powerful accountable while it openly and shamelessly fawns over the very people it is supposed to be critically investigating. The LA Times has an entire Instagram page devoted to showering Kamala Harris with praise, as can be seen by the puff piece tone of the overwhelming majority of the articles found there. This is just the most egregious example of the obvious coziness between the media and the Democrats which the former does not try to hide. And yet when these same outlets are accused of bias in favor of Democrats, they act as though this is an audacious and groundless accusation. The left-allied media seems genuinely perplexed that people call their credibility into question, such as deriding the media as “fake news”, even though they proudly proclaim their partisan alignment. Until the media stops playing favorites and starts consistently reporting the actual truth, this derision is completely deserved. 
2021-08-10;https://www.axios.com/biden-covid-vaccines-hurricane-preparedness-d06a3dbb-fefa-4954-bd52-1d0e70fdfb7d.html;As hurricanes barrel toward the southeastern coastal US, instead of offering actionable guidance for staying safe from the destructive storms, Biden stated that the number one thing potential hurricane victims should do is get vaccinated—as though vaccination will get Americans out of the path of the storm. How does this make any sense to any rational person? What Biden needed to do was urge finding shelter out of the hurricane’s path as the top priority for American families in harm’s way. So often, people think they can weather the storm and drown, so preventing these easily preventable—and immediately relevant to a hurricane—deaths should Biden’s objective. Staying in the path of the hurricane is thousands of times more likely to result in death than not vaccinating against COVID and contracting the disease. Any thinking person would immediately grasp that. So the fact that Biden is pushing the vaccine as some kind of hurricane preparation means either (a) he has lost so much of his mental faculties that he doesn’t understand this or (b) he knows that this guidance is absurd and he’s pushing it anyway because the Democrats have made it their mission to enrich the pharmaceutical companies. Hitting the estimated herd immunity threshold of 70% is also a coveted goal of the Biden administration, so this provides even more motivation to as much government activity as possible toward inducing people to get vaccinated. Vaccination is such a singular, obsessive focus for Democrats that it really ought to raise suspicions, or at least critical questions, in the minds of every American. 
2021-08-11;https://twitter.com/SteveDeaceShow/status/1425433443668742149;While the Democrats and their subordinate bureaucrats and media entities are reporting that children are contracting COVID at record rates, the CDC’s own data shows that child infections are just over half of their peak value (1.8% of all US hospitalizations, compared with 3.4% at its height). This talking point is looming larger and larger in the public discourse, driving more adamant calls for unvaccinated adults and children to vaccinate. This is clearly a scare tactic, and one that is not borne out in the data. Yet again, real science is being pushed to the side in favor of advancing an agenda. Initially, the research indicating that children are infected at significantly lower rates than adults was accepted across partisan lines. But now that adult vaccinations are at the saturation point (i.e. everyone who wants one has gotten one), the Democrats are trying to scare parents into vaccinating their young children, and scare the holdout adults, so that they can further enrich their Big Pharma donor friends. Although there is nothing to suggest that the appearance of COVID was any kind of conspiracy at this time—all available evidence shows it to be an accident—the government is quite obviously using the pandemic as the pharmaceutical version of the bank bailout in 2008. All the more ironically, the left-wingers are all for pushing vaccinations, even though it massively enriches the corporations they despise. It just goes to show how the left believes in nothing except empowering itself and dictating to everyone else. 
2021-08-12;https://twitter.com/jakecoco/status/1425660734378217472;While the left advances the narrative that only morons aren’t getting vaccinated, a study from Carnegie Mellon University indicates that in terms of educational demographics, the largest group that is declining vaccination is PhD recipients. What’s even more revealing is that, data on fields of PhDs awarded show that the two largest categories of PhDs earned are in biomedical and engineering fields. In other words, most PhD-holders are not humanities majors, but people with technical and scientific training. The fact that the most rational, critical thinking segment of Americans is choosing not to get vaccinated more than any other should be a huge indicator on how safe these vaccines really are. 
2021-08-12;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/rand-paul-marjorie-taylor-greene-suspended-from-social-media-for-covid-disinfo/;When Republicans question the effectiveness of masks and vaccines, social media (acting in faithful service of the Democratic Party) censors them, even when pro-Democrat media and government bodies say the same thing. Rand Paul and Marjorie Taylor Green have both been censored for claiming that masks and vaccines do not slow the transmission of the virus. But the CDC is articulating this exact same fact but in a different way: they are warning that vaccinated and unvaccinated people can both spread the virus at roughly the same rate. That is the exact same thing as saying that the vaccines aren’t effective at controlling the spread. The fact that social media imposes a partisan filter for who can express this information shows just how pro-left tech companies are skewed. When a society, whether by the actions of government of the private sector, decides who is ordained to bear the truth, that is the beginning of the end of American values of liberty. The whole point of the First Amendment is that no one is allowed to decide who may and may not speak, and that Americans should get to decide for themselves what is and isn’t true.

Until now, the Democrats claimed that Biden’s handling of illegal immigration was no worse than under previous presidents. But now that the American people have actual data to base that assessment on, it turns out that that’s a lie. Record numbers of people are streaming into the US during a global pandemic, and the Biden administration is just sitting on its hands.

This comes after a recent statement in which she justified her significant expenditure on security and the immediately pivoted to calling to “defund the police”. Now it turns out that she was (until the officers were fired for moonlighting against department policy) literally funding them. You can’t make this staggering hypocrisy up. 
2021-08-13;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-58204206;After only about a week of working back in school buildings, Florida teachers unions are already reporting that teachers are dying of COVID. Despite barbs thrown at Florida’s governor about not mandating masks or vaccines, this is not a prohibition on either of those—individuals may still choose to be vaccinated or wear masks if they wish. Florida also has full vaccination rates on par with the US average, at 50%. So the fact that Florida is as vaccinated as anywhere else and teachers are still dying shows how transmissible coronavirus is even when vaccinated people abound. Especially considering that teachers are among the most left-wing group of people around, there is a good chance that their vaccination rates exceed their regional averages. If so many teachers are vaccinated, then the only way that so many teachers could die so quickly is if the vaccines didn’t stop transmission. And to transmit, you have to have contracted the disease, which also means that vaccinated individuals are not overcoming COVID substantially faster than their unvaccinated counterparts. It is still early on, but given the data that is already available on the Delta variant, there is a good chance that vaccinated teachers will start getting sick and dying from COVID, near or at the rate of unvaccinated people. 
2021-08-13;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1426318258655932422;Obama somehow claimed that his Martha’s Vineyard birthday party complied with CDC COVID guidelines despite guests not wearing masks indoors at close quarters, and then COVID cases in Martha’s Vineyard spiked less than 2 weeks later. Obama can’t have it both ways: either he and his guests didn’t observe CDC guidelines (which Democrats all claim we must do without fail despite flouting them all the time), or he did and vaccines and masks are not effective. Actually, either way this is yet more evidence that vaccines aren’t effective. If we take as true the claim that the overwhelming majority of attendees were vaccinated and yet COVID cases spiked, then vaccines obviously did not slow cases—and why would anyone test for COVID unless they experienced symptoms, so these were probably nearly all symptomatic cases. 
2021-08-14;https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2021-08-13/dhs-issues-new-terrorism-threat-alert-as-9-11-anniversary-approaches;The Department of Homeland Security has issued a terrorism alert which, among other things, cites those who resist the re-imposition of COVID-based restrictions on free association in the US as potential sources of terrorism—in other words, if you speak out against new lockdowns or vaccine mandates, the government can consider you a terrorist. The level of authoritarianism from the Biden administration is only continuing to ratchet up with alarming rapidity. Again, it bears repeating that under US federal law, those designated as terrorists do not enjoy the same Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights as normal American citizens and those living on US soil. That the government has now empowered itself to label political dissenters to strict COVID lockdowns and vaccine mandates as terrorists kicks the door to suppression of political opposition wide open. There are completely rational grounds upon which to oppose coercion to take vaccines and to strict lockdowns, including the need for all Americans to access economic participation, and the freedom one should have to choose one’s own medical treatment. But now these reasonable bones of contention with the prevailing political orthodoxy have been labeled potential indicators of terrorism. From there, it’s a short jump to cracking down on dissent, imprisoning the most vocal opponents. The lefties who reject the characterization of the Democrats as authoritarian, and brush off the right’s accusation of political persecution, are quickly losing rhetorical and rational wiggle-room. 
2021-08-16;https://twitter.com/CassandraRules/status/1427331578833817603;For completely inexplicable reasons, left-aligned CNN is treating the Taliban with kid gloves as it covers the 10-day coup of Afghanistan. Unlike the largely bloodless, unarmed, and temporally limited January 6 Riot, which the left describe as an “insurrection” and a “coup”, the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan was an actual coup: a government was overthrown and replaced with the government selected by the coup’s perpetrators. Yet even though this is the case, CNN is insisting on referring to the violent, armed Taliban takeover of Afghanistan as a “transfer of power”, the same language we use when a president peacefully and voluntarily steps down at the end of their term, in accordance with the law, so that a new one can be inaugurated. Why is CNN going easy on the Taliban? What does CNN benefit in portraying the Taliban in the most charitable possible light? The only possible gain that they could derive is to spare Biden the embarrassment of having Afghanistan collapse due to his sloppy handling of his withdrawal. The “transfer of power” language makes it sound like Biden wanted a Taliban takeover to coincide with the departure of US troops (which can’t possibly truly be the case).
2021-08-16;https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1427283078993547267;Also as part of its coverage, a hijab-clad female CNN journalist reporting from amid a crowd of Taliban insurgent fighters stated “They’re just chanting ‘Death to America’ but they seem friendly at the same time.” How are chants of “death to America” friendly in the slightest? Obviously, she couldn’t be too critical in their midst, lest one of them take offense and threaten her. But still, there is no reason she should have gone out of her way to depict hardened extremist insurgents in the most flattering light possible. She could have simply reported what was happening without any bent or angle, especially when the people she is reporting on are objectively ruthless and malicious hyper-conservative religious radicals. 
2021-08-16;https://twitter.com/TimRunsHisMouth/status/1427346585910923273;The left screamed that Trump was going to usher in hard-line religious conservative values to subjugate women, which he never did, but now that Biden has allowed a group of actual hard-line religious extremists who will force women into subservience to come to power, they have nothing to say. If the left was consistent in their principles, they would be outraged that Biden’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, Afghan women will be barred from dressing as they choose, associating freely in public, or attending school or work under the Taliban. This is as regressive a step for women’s rights as anyone can imagine. And yet the Democrats have nothing to say about this—they don’t seem the least bit fazed, and have offered no criticism of Biden. With this catastrophic failure under Biden’s watch, Biden has resulted in more women around the world being deprived of their human rights and freedom than Trump. 
2021-08-16;https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/grim-warning-israel-vaccination-blunts-does-not-defeat-delta;Data from Israel analyzing the Delta variant shows that, of those who are hospitalized with COVID infections, individuals who are fully vaccinated with the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA COVID vaccines account for 59% of patients. This blows a colossal hole in the notion, repeated incessantly in pro-vaccine messaging, that vaccines overwhelmingly insulate their recipients from the worst of COVID. Considering that more COVID hospital patients are vaccinated than not, it would seem that vaccines are not effective at thwarting the worst possible COVID cases. This new data also seriously questions the overall public health effectiveness of the vaccines. Israel has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, at 78%. This easily exceeds the threshold which public health experts agree must be reached to achieve “herd immunity”. And yet, their current case rate is about as high as it was before any vaccines were available there (roughly a year ago). This adds credence to the idea that the virus rapidly outflanks the vaccines by mutation, offering vaccinated individuals fleeting protection from COVID. The whole notion behind herd immunity is that, because the “herd” is largely vaccinated, there are limited transmission vectors for the virus, so that it would not be able to jump between enough infected people to reach individuals who cannot be vaccinated. But with the same case rate at 78% full vaccination as the case rate at essentially no vaccination, by definition this means herd immunity does not apply with COVID. If 78% vaccination provided herd immunity, there would be nowhere near this many symptomatic, and severe, cases among the vaccinated. 
2021-08-18;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1428094409137135616;When conservatives (validly) observe social media’s hypocrisy in banning Trump but allowing the Taliban’s accounts to stay active, liberals fire back that the Taliban “play[s] by the rules”. But given what the Taliban deliberately does and publicizes on social media, such as killing women who refuse to wear a veil and sadistically torturing US-allied Afghans, how can these not fall afoul of any rules on “community standards”? Trump was banned for social media for supposedly inciting the violence that took place on January 6, even though what he posted on social media is NOT considered incitement as per prior First Amendment case rulings in the US judicial system. And yet at the same time, the Taliban have not been banned from social media despite being a known terrorist organization and regularly to torturing and murdering innocent, peaceful people. People are even censored on social media for such benign acts as stating “disinformation”, even if the contents of their post are confirmed by scientific studies but merely contradict the left’s preferred political narrative. Given these patterns, there is no rational explanation for why the American political right (and center, for that matter) is censored while terrorist killers are not. Can social media companies really make the case, with a straight face, that the Taliban have never used their social media account to (1) advocate imminent and specific violence, (2) convey untruthful statements, or (3) express hate speech? If one is looking to censor the Taliban, this third point should be so easily applicable that it would be impossible not to find an instance of it. The Taliban literally hate women, LGBT people, and all non-Muslims, and they state as much very directly and scornfully. 
2021-08-19;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1428483868894666766;California gubernatorial recall election ballots issued in LA County feature a hole in the envelope which allows anyone handling the ballot to know if the voter voted to initiate a recall election. The hole on the front of the envelope is such that, depending on which way the ballot is inserted into the envelope, aligns with the “Yes” bubble for voting to initiate a formal recall election. This design makes it trivially easy for the officials processing mailed ballots, who are Democrats (as nearly every elected official in LA County is), to simply discard the ballots of voters who wish to unseat the state’s Democrat governor. There is no explicable reason why the ballot envelope needed to be designed with that hole. And the fact that its placement just happens to reveal whether a given voter wants to initiate the Democrats’ most politically vulnerable election (having a Democrat unseated as governor in the most Democrat-leaning state in the nation) is highly suspicious, to say the least. The possibility that Democrats cheated in 2020 now seems increasingly likely given this circumstantial evidence, and the Democrats are going to have a harder time arguing that their victories are totally above board when there exists such obviously exploitable potential to cheat at elections like this. Every American everywhere in the country should be outraged at this blow to election integrity—even assuming the placement of the hole wasn’t intentional, it shows that those who designed the ballot are woefully inept, in a way that leaves elections open to tampering. Whether through malice or incompetence, mistakes like this cannot be allowed to happen. 
2021-08-20;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1428825878818004995;After mercilessly investigating the January 6 Riots for what the left swore would be sure signs of an “insurrection”, the FBI could not find any evidence that there was any organized plot to overthrow the US government by force on January 6, 2021. Claims by the left that the FBI is disincentivized to find any anti-government plots is eminently absurd and laughable. First, the FBI IS the government, so they have the reason of self-preservation to investigate allegations of insurrection as seriously as possible. Second, the FBI is well-known to have a left-leaning bias, if not before Trump’s presidency than certainly during it, after he fired James Comey and derided the intelligence community at every turn. So the fact that the FBI, which probably also had informants and undercover agents distributed throughout the rioters, could not find any evidence of insurrectionary motives or attempts means there almost certainly weren’t any. This line of sound reasoning blows a gaping hole in the left’s rationale for censoring and suppressing the political right, and the expansion of state power necessary for the task. If Democrats in federal government posts proceed to arrogate security state powers unto itself, it will be doing so with significantly less justification than it was previously able to marshal. 
2021-08-20;https://twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1428849753517969419;Twitter labeled an unedited video of women stealing ballots from mailboxes as “presented out of context”, tipping their hand (by inference) yet again that they do the bidding of the Democrats. There is nothing unclear or misleading about the video, as it shows exactly what is purported: it plainly shows two women stealing ballots from mailboxes, which any viewer can visually distinguish from the footage (the ballot mailers are distinctly recognizable items of postal mail). If Twitter had not appended any label to the tweet, they could have safely appeared to be non-partisan. After all, no one (as yet) knows the partisan affiliation of the two thieves, so it was equally possible that the women were pro-Democrat as they were pro-Republican (aside from the fact that demographically more women are the former than the latter). But because Twitter rushed to declare this ambiguously partisan act of voter suppression as essentially fake news, it implies that they worried that the video would harm the Democrats. They’ve helped the Democrats in the past, such as by suppressing the Hunter Biden laptop story, so why wouldn’t they do so again. If these were pro-Republican women stealing ballots, would any thinking person suppose that Twitter would label the video as “out of context”? Of course not. 
2021-08-24;Police in Torrance, CA arrested a man in possession of more than 300 mail-in ballots for the California gubernatorial recall election, which targets Democrat governor Newsom with early removal from office. Although California media is quick to hide behind the veneer of objectivity in suggesting that it is “not clear” what the motive behind this theft of ballots is, the motive is crystal clear to any thinking person. Simple deduction will not only show the obvious motive, but also illustrate that it clearly benefits the Democrats. There are only two things which can be done with stolen ballots: destroy them or vote with them. Not only are ballots of greater value when used for voting, but if the thief wanted to destroy them, they would have been destroyed already and not recovered by police. Also, although it’s possible that the thief was caught in transit to sell the ballots to a third-party, it’s more likely that the thief intended to use them—again, if the thief intended to offload them, they likely would have been already. So this leaves the thief’s own intentions to vote with the ballots as the most logical explanation. But who would the thief vote for? The thief also had a weapon and illegal drugs, so it is clear that he is a career criminal. Do you think—does anyone think—that this career criminal will vote for the “law and order” Republicans, or the “defund the police” Democrats? If the answer isn’t obviously “Democrats” to you, you are deluded.

Using vaccine passports as a prerequisite for participating in economic life is, by the Woke’s own definition, systemically racist because black people are the least-vaccinated group in America, meaning they will fall short of vaccine passport requirements at higher rates than any other racial group. Yes this does not trouble the left at all, and they do not regard themselves as racist for standing by a policy which fits their definition of racism to the letter. The left has clearly arrogated unto itself the right to bend their own definition of systemic racism when it skewers an initiative they wan to promote. This is proof that no one can ascribe any credence, credibility, or good-faith rational grounding for any characterization of something by the left as “systemically racist”: it has no consistent meaning, but attacks anything they oppose (no matter how fair and reasonable) and nothing they embrace (no matter how repugnantly discriminatory). Any faction that will simply dismiss such blatant contradictions is not operating in good faith—they don’t genuinely want to do what’s best, but are only out for themselves.

This mother did not pose any serious danger ot her child, as COVID case data shows that young children are extremely unlikely to suffer a symptomatic or severe case of COVID. This being the case, on what grounds can a judge revoke a mother’s right to child custody? If she isn’t proven to be dangerous or negligent, a judge has no right intervening in a parent’s choices regarding family health. Democrats and their proxies in the judiciary, the media, and the private sector are proving their critics right by using vaccine requirements as a mechanism of social control. How else can you describe this judge’s decision? What other purpose could they have in mind in demanding proof of vaccination (so-called “vaccine passports”) to frequent businesses when all credible available data shows that the vaccinated and unvaccinated spread COVID at the same rate, and in the case of individuals under 50 suffer the same rates of death from COVID?

The whole point of the ACLU is that it stand for Americans’ rights, and nothing else—no party, no elected leader, no ideology. Ever since Trump was elected, the entire ACLU has been slowly entering the embrace of the Democrats, but now they have openly sworn allegiance to the Democrats. All their work from here on it is, and should be (rightly), suspect in regards to its motives. A nation founded on liberty is truly in dire straits if a once laudable and high-minded defender of liberties has thrown in its lot with one party over the other. This leaves no entity above the fray, with the credibility to stand behind liberty for its own sake and have its voice taken seriously. And because the ACLU was regarded as the most principled defender of civil liberties, this move signals that no one views liberties as more precious or worthy of defense than party. If THE civil liberties champion is now just an arm of the Democrats, what does that say about how highly they regard civil rights? And this is at a time when Democrats are unabashedly censoring their political opponents and trying to coerce Americans into ingesting an insufficiently tested substance (the COVID vaccines) in order to participate in the economy. The ACLU has clearly lost its way, and deserves the respect of no one. But, of course, they will continue to trade on their name, and fool many Americans into thinking their partisan doing of the Democrats’ bidding is in the nonpartisan service of Americans’ rights.

It appears that the Biden administration was attempting to go over the heads of the FDA to get booster doses of mRNA COVID vaccines approved faster than the FDA intended to approve them. However, it seems unlikely that this is just about how fast the booster would be approved—if it were just about dates, why would FDA experts resign? Wouldn’t that be a drastic step to take, to resign in protest over which week or month the approval took place in? There’s a good chance, then, that there are more fundamental differences between Biden and the FDA regarding vaccines than timing.
2021-09-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1433408475535749121;Doctors are now violating their Hippocratic Oath by denying medical services to those who have been critical of COVID-related public health measures. A prominent conservative voice was denied services at a COVID testing facility for questioning the effectiveness and potential harms of different COVID mitigation efforts, something which every open and democratic society should do with weighty decisions. It is one thing for a doctor to disagree with those who criticize public health efforts—they have just as much a right to speak their mind as anyone else—but they swore an oath to treat everyone in need. To deny medical services on any grounds, but especially political ones, is unconscionable and unsettling. First and foremost, it signals to other medical professionals that it’s OK to let those they disagree with suffer and die. That is the most inhumane, dispassionate thing that a person who is supposed to care for people can possibly do. Second, and more immediate in its harms, is that it ultimately results in more harm to the community. By not seeing those who may test positive for COVID, they are leaving the door open for COVID to spread. If nothing else, this makes their job harder, since it will result in fuller hospitals. 
2021-09-01;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1433434409969938440;The ACLU has come out to say that vaccine mandates, the literal requiring of people to ingest a chemical substance against their will, promotes civil liberties. This is the complete inverse of civil liberties, which any rational person should be able to conclude for themselves easily. It is preposterous to argue, as the ACLU does, that forcing the majority to take a substance against their will for the sake of a minority constitutes an expansion of civil liberty. To mandate masks, which pose no harm to the wearer but may help the ACLU’s same example victims is one thing. But when it comes to the freedom of bodily autonomy, coercing the majority for the sake of a minority is a contraction of individual liberty, even if most of the majority would have done so willingly. But as we know, there are far more objectors to the vaccine than victims of low vaccination rates. And in this case, the ACLU’s case has all of its legs knocked out from under it in light of the fact that the vaccine has been shown to not reduce the spread of COVID at all (only, in some limited and shrinking number of cases, the severity of COVID). If spread is unaffected by vaccination, then mandating vaccination is totally groundless.

Biden was caught on camera looking at his watch during a ceremony to honor the troops slain in the attack on the Kabul airport during Biden’s disastrous withdrawal. Instead of acknowledging, as rational people did, the reality of what actually happened, the Democrat-subservient press tried to play off the incident as fake news. They even used the same language in their headlines that they did to insist that Trump was lying (the smug “This is misleading” as the headline’s second sentence). But not only does video plainly show what happened, but the families (plural) of fallen soldiers all witnessed this. In essence, if reality doesn’t agree with the Democrats, either they or their attack dogs in the press insist that reality somehow did not transpire as they did. And then they have the gall to patronizingly tell the the American people what is and isn’t true. Anyone who consumes the sources who played along with the Democrats’ baseless denial does not get to say that they condemn “fake news”—they consume just that.

The press, across dozens of outlets, has launched an aggressive campaign to paint ivermectin as a purely animal treatment that no human should ever use, even though there is no proof that it is dangerous when administered in the proper dosage. And yet the CDC itself advocates for its use in refugees. If it WERE actually solely an animal drug, the left should decry this as racist—why should refugees get animal drugs instead of human drugs? But of course, this is not the case, as ivermectin was invented for use in humans, and is still used to treat humans all over the world every day. The more curious thing is that the CDC, seeing the press deride the use of ivermectin while recommending it to the most vulnerable in our community, have not stepped in to clear the air. Why is that? Do they want misconceptions regarding this drug to spread? Or are they committed to pushing the vaccine first and foremost, so any alternative recourse for fighting COVID is stifled?
2021-09-04;https://twitter.com/ConceptualJames/status/1434277305472409602;A doctor’s claim that a rural hospital was so overrun with ivermectin overdose patients that it couldn’t treat gunshot victims was completely debunked by the hospital in which this fabricated development supposedly occurred. The hospital at the center of the claims clarified that the physician who originated the false claim was a contractor, and had not treated patients at their facility in months. If ivermectcin is so dangerous, then doctors with an evidently leftist agenda shouldn’t have to make up stories about overdoses and complications from it—true stories would be readily available. So the fact that they are making stories up means that ivermectin is not as dangerous as the left-wing vaccine-pushers would like everyone to believe. 
2021-09-07;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/gaming-ceo-ousted-after-tweeting-hes-proud-to-support-texas-abortion-ban/;A company’s CEO got fired for expressing a perfectly valid political point of view from a personal social media account. A video game company’s CEO was forced out for expressing approval of Texas’s recently passed restriction of abortions after 6 weeks. To those who sincerely regard unborn fetuses as full-fledged humans, as many Christians and other religions’ adherents do, restricting the scope of when a woman can receive an abortion would be praiseworthy. This law is also consistent with the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling, as abortion is still available to women in Texas. But since this opinion did not align with the left, the CEO had to be punished for expressing it. And, of course, the idea that companies should simply limit all political speech is preposterous, considering that they don’t fire any employees for calling for defunding the police or other left policy objectives.

It would be one thing for a hospital system to not proactively advocate treatment of COVID with ivermectin, as studies suggesting its effectiveness are few and preliminary. But if a patient requests a safe dosage of a safe drug, and consents to assume all risk, what business does a medical provider have in denying them? What are these doctors afraid might happen?
2021-09-08;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1435697236374085639;A popular late night television host stated that those who are not vaccinated against COVID should be denied treatment at hospitals for COVID should they need it. There is literally nothing more repugnant than advocating that doctors violate their Hippocratic Oaths and let people die. Up until now, we lived in a society in which no one in need would be denied emergency medical care, regardless of how we feel about the ethics of their personal health choices. There has never been mass advocacy of smokers being denied lung cancer treatments, nor (as Greenwald points out) of the obese being denied heart disease treatment. And with good reason: it would be unfathomably cruel. We can encourage them to make healthier choices while still doing our best to save them in their hour of need. But with the left, there is literally no depths of callousness to which they won’t sink to signal their allegiance to the Democrats and their ideology. Anyone who believes as Jimmy Kimmel does on this matter is, evidently, a sadistic and soulless partisan sheep. 
2021-09-08;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1435790224995414021;When black Republican gubernatorial candidate Larry Elder was attacked in an overtly racist attack, the left-aligned media which claims to care deeply for racial justice gave it practically no attention. The left claims to care so deeply about stopping racism, but when a white woman in a gorilla ask attacks a black Republican—symbolism that almost everyone would agree is racist—the left didn’t so much as lift a finger in his defense. This is yet more proof that the left’s supposed crusade against racism is a sham: any true opponent of racism would stand against it no matter who its victim is. But clearly, the left doesn’t care about victims of racism on the right. Could it be because then the left would have to own up to their own racism?

The First Amendment guarantees the free exercise of religion, yet United Airlines sees fit to tread on employees’ religious beliefs by depriving them of income unless they take a vaccine that was developed using embryonic stem cells, which Christians and other religious adherents view as the murder of the unborn. Taking a moral stance against what, to some, is murder apparently costs one’s income now.

This leaves millions of federal government employees with no alternative but to inject an experimental substance into their bodies (remember, the FDA only approved the vaccine after less than 2 years of data when they normally require 5 years of data at a minimum) which they may object to on moral grounds (as it was researched using embryonic stem cells, which Christians view as murdered infants). This is an affront to the very idea of liberty. Furthermore, no one can make a credible case that Biden just underestimated the pandemic and had to adopt a vaccine mandate as a result. As a former Vice President, as a presidential candidate, and at the time of his initial statement as president-elect, Biden had access to classified briefings as well as a team of public health experts whom he could later appoint to his administration. Unless he got the shoddiest intelligence and public health projections of all time, there is no way he didn’t know in December 2020 that the pandemic would get as bad as it is now. So, he likely made the “no vaccine mandate” promise with reasonable knowledge of where the pandemic would go in a year’s time. Yet he made that promise anyway, knowing he had no intention of keeping it. Why? Because if he had said as a presidential candidate (or newly declared victor in a contentious election) that he would mandate vaccines for millions of federal government employees, moderates would defect to Trump. 
2021-09-10;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1436384880674357253;A news article covering Republicans’ calls for civil disobedience against COVID vaccine mandates painted such calls as an extraordinary and ominous development in our country when, in fact, Democrats called for civil disobedience barely a year earlier in encouraging the protests-turned-riots over George Floyd’s death. The article states that “it has been decades” since the nation has seen similar advocacy of civil disobedience, but this is not true: what are calls to march in the streets and disrupt traffic (a crime) without permits (also a crime) if not civil disobedience? This is not even a moral judgment against the Floyd protests, but merely facts. Committing misdemeanors but otherwise protesting peacefully is the very definition of civil disobedience, ergo the Floyd protests were acts of civil disobedience. But of course, the media owes it to their Democrat masters to paint the Republicans (and the right generally) as an especially dire threat to American democracy. In doing so, the media outlet of course links the resistance to vaccine mandates to the January 6 Riots, which of course have no connection. Questioning the integrity of the election, and rioting in the process, has nothing to do with insisting on the right to choose one’s own medical treatments. But by linking a conspicuous act of criminality (January 6) to a peaceful insistence on personal liberty and bodily autonomy, the latter is rendered illegitimate and worthy of condemnation. 
2021-09-10;https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1436465123040927764;In pushing his vaccine mandate, Biden outright lies and says that the unvaccinated risk spreading COVID to the vaccinated unless they themselves become vaccinated. This is a baldfaced lie. It is true that the unvaccinated spread COVID to the vaccinated, but the vaccinated can also spread COVID to the vaccinated, because as the research shows, the vaccine does not prevent the spread of COVID—it merely lessens the symptoms. Data on COVID transmission shows that the vaccinated spread COVID just as much as the unvaccinated. Emerging data is also suggesting that, for the middle-aged and younger and those without comorbidities, the vaccinated and unvaccinated get hospitalized at nearly the same rate and die at the same rate from COVID. The vaccine does appear to protect those with weak immune systems, the elderly, and those with comorbidities, but beyond that it is practically ineffective (at least as regards the now-dominant Delta variant). It is galling that Biden would push this transparent falsehood, and it shows how desperate he and his party are to push the vaccines. What possible incentive do the Democrats have to push vaccines which the data shows don’t make a difference for most people​​? The only possible rationales are (1) that the Democrats are THAT beholden to the pharmaceutical companies (even more than the Republicans who, despite initiating the accelerated vaccine research, have not pushed the vaccine anywhere near this aggressively), or (2) that the vaccine has now become such an effective proxy for sorting the country into first-class citizens (pro-Democrat) and second-class citizens (anti-Democrat) that they want to press their luck. Once they can pretend like they’ve provided people with every chance to get vaccinated, the Democrats can then tighten the restrictions on the unvaccinated to eject them from society. 
2021-09-11;https://twitter.com/rachelindisguis/status/1436293707217657857;In spite of insisting that the COVID vaccine mandate it is enforcing in the private sector is to ensure the safety of American workers, OSHA has stated that it will not track vaccine side effects even though it is a stipulation of the law they are invoking for the mandate itself. If the COVID vaccine has adverse side effects, shouldn’t OSHA want to know so that it can adjust its guidance? How can OSHA lay any legitimate claim to wanting to protect the health of American workers if it hash announced it will actively ignore any health threats from COVID vaccine side-effects? The stated reason is that OSHA does not want to side-effect reporting to discourage vaccination, but who is there to discourage if the vaccines are mandated (or be forced to endure inconvenient weekly testing)? How does it make any sense for OSHA to worry about discouraging people from doing something that is mandatory? And if the vaccine is so safe, and COVID is so much worse than any possible vaccine side effects, how discouraging could side-effects possibly be? This willful ignorance of the complete picture of its vaccine mandate enforcement, and the nonsensical justifications OSHA gives for its behavior, proves that this policy is not about public health. For whatever reason, a reason that probably has more than nothing to do with the fact that Biden is the top recipient of pharmaceutical campaign donations in the Democratic Party, the Democrats have decided that everyone has to get the vaccine, over any and all possible objections. Depending on the jurisdiction, some people are being forced to get the vaccine, with no testing alternative, irrespective of their religious convictions or beliefs in personal liberties. 
2021-09-12;https://twitter.com/catturd2/status/1437096172557148166;A new study shows that boys aged 12 to 15 are 4 to 6 times more likely to develop myocarditis as a result of the Pfizer mRNA COVID vaccine than to be hospitalized for COVID—a fact that even the ultra-left The Guardian admitted. Research has repeatedly shown that children, especially those 12 and under, are at minimal risk of contracting a serious case of COVID. But a new study confirms that this risk of COVID is so small, and the risk of complications from the COVID vaccine so comparatively high, that empirical reasons actually exist for why someone might want to decline the vaccine. While the same level of study has not established this, the same calculus could, and should, easily apply to other risk-benefit tradeoffs. Data shows that those who have contracted COVID already are at minimal risk of contracting it again, but run nearly the same risk of COVID vaccine side-effects as those who have never had COVID. So why should anyone scoff at the idea that those who have had COVID would decline the vaccine? It wouldn’t make these people any safer from the virus, but would roll the dice on potentially debilitating, even lifelong side-effects.

Even Trump, whom the left-aligned media widely panned as leading a disastrously disorganized administration, was able to get several times as many appointments confirmed as Biden did in the same timeframe. Biden apologists will try to point out (as the Axios article did) that Republican senators are blocking confirmations, but this is a completely invalid defense for two reasons. One, Democrats were just as adamant about blocking Trump appointments as the Republicans are about blocking Biden’s, if not more so. Two, Democrats have repeatedly threatened to abolish the Senate filibuster, so if they made good on this promise there would be no way that the (barely) majority party could lose on party-line votes. So in regards to the hurdles facing Biden and Trump appointments, they are roughly the same. It is hard for a fair reading of events to draw any other conclusion than that the Biden administration is many times more chaotic than the most damning charges of disorder that the left every flung at Trump.
2021-09-13;https://www.axios.com/police-protective-fence-capitol-riot-25bcd37a-8bd0-45fe-aa80-d97fb4a93a99.html;The Democrats, who insist that they have the undeniable mandate and overflowing affection of the public, are so scared of demonstrators voicing support for January 6 arrestees that they are reinstalling fencing around the Capitol Building. These are the same Democrats who insist that they will not stand for symbols of authoritarianism, as they fence off the nation’s Capitol like tyrants totalitarian states do. These preparations are being made in spite of the fact that (a) the demonstration is now known to law enforcement a week in advance and (b) that many of the rabble-rousing groups that spurred the lawbreaking during January 6 stated that they will not attend. There is less justification for fortifications than ever, yet the Democrats are bringing them back. The timing is, of course, highly convenient, as California’s Democrat governor is fighting for his seat against a recall election by a diverse field of Republicans. It would certainly help avoid the embarrassment of losing the governorship of the Democrat stronghold to end all strongholds by resuscitating the image of Republicans as lawless “terrorists” who can only be held at bay by fences and other military-grade responses. 
2021-09-14;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1437859878513438722;A US general was supposedly so worried that Trump would launch last-minute military action that he not only informed other military staff under his command to ignore lawful orders from the president, but contacted high-ranking military officials in China—an enemy nation which actively operates concentration camps and carries out genocide—to coordinate on how to manage the last couple weeks of Trump’s presidency. This is the very definition of treason: conspiring with foreign enemies to subvert the US constitution. If the Milley was so concerned about Trump abusing his authority, and so sure that Trump was mentally unfit to lead, he could have rallied the cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment, which could have removed Trump from office in a matter of days (if not hours). Instead, he took it upon himself to contravene the constitution. By definition, when an unelected military leader takes sole control of the military, away from his elected superior and constitutionally appointed wielder of military power, that is a coup. Coups are already a betrayal of the nation, but colluding with the Chinese military solidifies the allegation of treason, as it fits treason’s definition of aiding an enemy foreign power. Yet instead of regarding the revelation of Milley’s deeds as the perilous moment for our republic that it was, the left is praising Milley’s supposed shrewd judgment and commitment to principle. If evidence was lacking, and one needed convincing, that the left was authoritarian, this is the final, inescapable shred of proof. 
2021-09-15;https://twitter.com/CasuallyGreg/status/1438234851488894976;The left is condemning protest cries of “Fuck Biden” as dangerous, subversive, and illegal despite being the same people who exclaimed “Fuck Trump” for the last 5 years. Left commentators are declaring the innocuous (if profane) expressions of anger and disapproval that is “Fuck Biden” as not only harmful to society but as actually illegal, despite the fact that such expressions are squarely protected by the First Amendment. Not only that, but they are condemning the exact kind of language they themselves engaged in less than a year ago. This double-standard is what is truly dangerous: it reinforces the emerging precedent that only the left may enjoy free speech, and that any dissent from its dictates does not. We are quickly entering a stage in society in which there is no effective free speech. First the left exhorted its Big Tech friends to censor right-of-left content from their platforms, hiding behind the fig leaf that platforms can moderate content as they want. Now, they are extending the censorship to the analog world, trying to stamp out protests in the public where free speech has been almost unassailable for decades. 
2021-09-15;https://twitter.com/ConceptualJames/status/1438250015835709444;New polling shows that a majority of parents across all racial demographics oppose the teaching of Critical Race Theory (CRT) in schools. The majority opposition to CRT holds for white parents, black parents, and Hispanic parents. However, when surveying the general population (parents and the childless), opposition to CRT drops to around 50%. This goes to show that those who have no business mandating what students should and should not learn make up the bulk of CRT’s proponents. These people should not get to dictate the content of education over the objections of the parents of the students whom schools serve. But of course, if the views of CRT were so rational, reasonable, and grounded in evidence, its advocates would not have to resort to spreading it via indoctrination. The weaker and less justifiable a view, the more it has to be forced on people. 
2021-09-17;VRBPAC-09.17.21-Meeting-Briefing-Document-FDA.pdf;According to a briefing for the FDA in regards to approving booster doses of the Comirnaty mRNA COVID vaccine, those who are vaccinated have a HIGHER rate of contracting COVID than those who are unvaccinated. It is hard to dispute this data as it comes directly from the FDA. If the FDA knew this, and not only didn’t halt the rollout of the mRNA COVID shot but went as far as approving a booster dose of it, then what’s going on? Isn’t this exactly the kind of alarming data that the FDA is charged with identifying and investigating for the sake of public safety? Anyone who follows the science should be seriously alarmed by this data, and the American people are owed at least a thorough independent review (i.e. not based on data supplied by the pharmaceutical companies) of the mRNA vaccines. 
2021-09-21;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1440313872334798856;A Politico reporter confirmed that many damning emails that the New York Post supposedly recovered by from Hunter Biden’s laptop are genuine. This is significant because every arm of the political left establishment worked in concert to try to discredit the emails as inauthentic: the CIA pronounced that they were likely “Russian disinformation”, Big Tech social media platforms censored the New York Post’s reporting, and the media spun these moves by their allies as necessary for protecting the truth. But in reality, all of this acted in service of lies, not the truth. And, sure enough, the Bidens never disavowed or disputed the authenticity of any of the emails. But this tawdry episode illustrates that, when it comes to serving the Democrats, all the nation’s power centers are in lockstep in their efforts to suppress the truth. And, of course, the left’s supporters are unperturbed by any of this: they see nothing alarming about the intelligence community, the corporate media, and tech behemoths banding together to decide what to convince Americans to believe and, with an election on the line, whom to elect to the most powerful political office in the world. 
2021-09-24;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/09/cdc-director-overrules-experts-allows-pfizer-boosters-for-health-workers/;After the CDC’s own panel of experts voted against recommending booster doses of the Pfizer mRNA COVID vaccine to frontline health workers, the head of the CDC contradicted this assessment to unilaterally issue guidance for this group to receive booster vaccination. How can the CDC, and its supporters, claim to support “the science” if they are literally contradicting the carefully considered judgment of the CDC’s own experts? What incentive does the head of the CDC have to do so? After the debacle in which the CDC stopped advising masking to push vaccinations, the organization’s credibility is already under serious strain, so one would think that the head of the organization would be careful to push the limits further. What does the CDC get out of mandating boosters when they aren’t needed and, moreover, when they can go to more vulnerable groups like those over 65?
2021-09-26;https://twitter.com/OrwellNGoode/status/1442267887629049861;A number of online publications that (1) skew left and (2) anoint themselves as the defenders of truth and reason have started running op-eds warning readers against critical thought, thinking for themselves, or questioning the left orthodox. There is only one class of people who advocate against thinking for oneself, and that is authoritarians and their sycophantic bootlickers. The left-leaning media wants to stay in the Democrats’ good graces as the latter pushes more and more audacious mandates on an unwilling populace, so they are now running editorials which instruct people to submit and obey the elites without question. It’s as transparent as it is worthy of ridicule, as it is alarming. Not only does our country have a large swath of the public who are willing to obey, but to force others to obey as well. In spite of what our constitution may say, the will of the majority, if carried out by force, can be imposed on the minority. 
2021-09-28;https://twitter.com/ChristinaPushaw/status/1442819652355334149;Biden’s press secretary is insisting that it would be ridiculous to expect corporations to raise the prices of their goods and services in response to increased corporate taxation. It is commonly accepted, and confirmed by economists and business experts, that in practically all respects, companies pass costs on to their customers. That’s actually how business works: in order to make a profit, companies have to raise the costs of their goods/services ABOVE the total cost of production. If the cost of production goes up for whatever reason—whether it be supply shortages or increased taxation—companies prefer to pass the cost onto consumers through a price increase than to accept less profit. More specifically, this is how sales tax works already. Sales tax was devised as a way to tax businesses for the right the make sales, but it has long since been passed on to consumers—in fact, consumers are so inured to it that they take it as a given. With all of this in mind, there is every reason to suspect that increased corporate taxes would simply pass through the corporation and hit consumers. It is incumbent upon the Biden administration, then, to make a detailed case for why this would not be so under their plan, instead of brushing off this very rational concern of a de facto middle class tax increase as somehow ludicrous.

Among the censorship the social media platform has vowed to carry out is silencing of certain first-person accounts of individuals who have experienced COVID vaccine side effects, their family members. If YouTube were making its own, totally independent determinations about what COVID-related content to censor, that would be one thing—agree or disagree, it would be consistent with legal precedent establishing that private social networks can moderate however they choose (i.e. they are not obligated to uphold your First Amendment rights). But it is a virtual certainty that they are taking cues from the government on what is “accurate” or “inaccurate” COVID information, despite the fact that the CDC has reversed course on its guidance several times, and in some cases for reasons that have nothing to do with the science (e.g. when they dropped mask mandates to induce people to get vaccinated). 
2021-09-30;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1443035396754051078;A major left-wing media outlet is calling for employers to fire all their unvaccinated employees, implying that this would only affect conservatives/Trump supporters who deserve neither financial security nor rights in the left-winger’s mind. Not only is this a sickeningly callous policy to advocate for, but as Greenwald implies (hinting at previous analyses of the true demographic breakdown of the unvaccinated), it would not only hit Trump supporters hard but racial minorities. Black Americans are among the least-vaccinated groups of people in the country, and by the left’s (specifically Kendi’s) own teachings, anything which disproportionately impacts black people is automatically and irredeemably racist. So, if the left was ideologically consistent, they could never advocate for this policy because of how it would cause a spike in black unemployment. But not only is the left staggeringly hypocritical, but it doesn’t truly care about black people at all. If the left cared about black people, they would put more effort into reducing the black homicide rate, since black Americans kill more black Americans than any other group. If the left cared about black people, they wouldn’t be rushing to do away with objective standards for math and reading in the name of “racial justice” (as was recently done in Oregon), implying that it’s unreasonable to expect black children to reach the same standards as children of other races—it’s hard to imagine any more racist sentiment than that. If the left really cared about black people, they wouldn’t have tried to restrict access to menthol cigarettes with the explicit aim of improving the health of black Americans, implying not only that they believe a race-based stereotype to be true, but that black Americans are too stupid to be swayed by public health campaigns and so could only be saved from themselves by a practical ban on an unhealthy product.

Of course, this is not a trend the left-subservient media is making much comment on. If they could refute this trend as a trick of the data, they would, but because they can’t, it’s being ignored. Admittedly, in the interest of intellectual honesty, it could be that there is not far for cases to decrease in a highly vaccinated population—if case rates are indeed low, then there is less room for cases to drop before hitting zero. Or it could be that large unvaccinated populations have gone through COVID surges which are now subsiding. But in reality, we know that the entire US experienced a surge. If the vaccines were so effective, there would not have been a surge nationwide roughly 2 months ago which hit every part of the country—instead, the nationwide summer surge would have just hit the unvaccinated regions and spared the vaccinated ones. That unvaccinated-only surge, of course, is not what happened. The sluggish drop in case rates in the more vaccinated states is also consistent with data indicating high case rates in highly vaccinated developed countries like the UK and Israel. What’s more likely is that vaccinated people are driving the cases, because these individuals are more likely to engage in activity which risks contracting COVID, as they believe the vaccine totally insulates them from COVID’s effects. This would also explain why there are more cases where vaccination is high than where it is low.
2021-09-30;https://twitter.com/iamjasonbailey/status/1443601078205960199;Employers are now beginning to require their employees family members to be vaccinated, under penalty of fine assessed every pay period. As the CDC has admitted (and as stated here countless times), vaccination has no bearing on disease transmission. Requiring that employees spouses get vaccinated has no effect on whether an employee they live with (vaccinated or unvaccinated) will contract COVID. It also represents an alarming and creepy overreach of employers into their employees lives. As we have seen, employers have used the pandemic to justify the installation of surveillance software on employees’ devices to ensure productivity. Between that and the expansion of effective working hours that is an extension of working from home, employers have an unprecedented degree of control over their employees’ lives, not seen since the days of Upton Sinclair’s The Jungle. That employers feel free to make this latest, most audacious incursion into their employees’ lives should concern everyone, regardless of their stance on vaccination. 
2021-10-01;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/10/covid-19-vaccines-will-be-added-to-immunization-list-required-for-ca-students/;The Democrat governor of California, the most populous state in the US, has signaled that the state will now coerce students, most of whom are minors, to take the vaccine to attend school. With the stroke of a pen, Newsom is poised to deny the freedom of bodily autonomy to millions of people. And, as we know, home-schooling is not an option for everyone. Working and lower class people, a disproportionate segment of whom are racial minorities, often do not have the time to educate children and earn enough o put food on the table. As such, this policy will disproportionately affect black people, which the Democrats have tacitly accepted (from Kendi) as a naked and unpardonable act of racism. More importantly, children are the least at risk of serious harm from COVID. Data consistently shows that the death rate from COVID among children is significantly lower than for the general population (and certainly more than that of the population which makes up the most deaths: those over 50 and/or with underlying health conditions). So, children should be the last group of people in our society whom we should require to be vaccinated—if they have the lowest risk of infection, they will also provide society with the least benefit from being vaccinated and staying out of hospitals which they would have almost all stayed out of without vaccination anyway. 
2021-10-01;https://outsidevoices.substack.com/p/the-nyts-partisan-tale-about-covid;The New York Times got caught using bad statistics to try to paint conservatives as the cause of the pandemic’s prolongation. The publication failed to control their data for other variables, committing a statistical manipulation called “confounding variables” to conveniently overlook the more direct indicator of COVID susceptibility, age and population density, to paint conservatives as the problem. As the critic of the reporting points out, older people tend to vote Republican, and are also more likely to get sick and die from COVID. People in rural areas also tend to vote Republican, and have the consistently most limited access to health care, such as hospitals. The New York Times has enough professional history and resources to know better than to make this mistake. So, either they’ve gotten egregiously sloppy, or this was an intentional manipulation.

It is not clear at this time whether or not these airlines will allow any kind of exemptions to the mandate for religious convictions. But as stated numerous times here, vaccination has no bearing on whether or not one spreads COVID. There’s no way that these major private companies don’t know this. It is entirely possible, then, that they are using vaccine mandates as a way to reduce the amount of sick time they have to grant to employees. This is a return to the pre-union days when robber baron business owners would squeeze every last ounce of productivity out of their employee. Strangely, the left does not seem at all concerned about this regression of labor rights. But this is probably because the left has abdicated all of its principles in order to adopt whatever argument justifies coercing their enemies in the moment, regardless of the precedent it sets in the long term.

This all correlates to the Biden administration’s disastrous pullout from Afghanistan, proving to the world that our military is now inept, and uninterested in aiding our allies. China could not have gotten a clearer signal that the time will soon be ripe for them to annex Taiwan. Although Trump also intended to leave Afghanistan, in contrast to Biden, Trump maintained firm economic and military-deterrent pressure on China. This is the closest Taiwan has ever come to invasion, and it is taking place under Biden’s careless watch. Hey may yet prove to the the US president that loses Taiwan to the yoke of the Chinese Communist Party.

This is a resounding rebuke to those centrists who swore that Biden would never give way to the radical wing of his party, which is seeking to use the weight of the federal government to remake society into a full-bodied welfare state. 
2021-10-03;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.19.21262139v1;A medical research journal pre-print paper indicates that fully vaccinated individuals are more likely to be infected with variant strains of COVID which carry resistance to antibodies. This is something that anyone who has taken a high school biology class should be able to easily explain. As the inventor of mRNA technology, Dr. Robert Malone, has publicly stated, vaccinating during a pandemic is the worst time to do so, because it drives the evolution of the virus to avoid antibodies. This recent study is bearing this fact out plain as day. The pandemic is continuing not because the unvaccinated insisting on not vaccinating, but because the vaccinated accelerate the virur’s evolution. If no one had gotten vaccinated, and instead effective repurposed drugs had been used to treat those who contract COVID, the SARS-CoV-2 virus would not have been driven to evolve. Instead, the virus would have infected everyone it could have, been beaten by patients’ drug-boosted immune systems which would then develop natural immunity, and then exhausted its human hosts before evolving to circumvent natural immunity antibodies. 
2021-10-04;https://twitter.com/ChristianWalk1r/status/1445165345895899136;A university student video-recorded a call with a registrar’s office staffer asking him to provide proof of vaccination, despite taking exclusively online classes, or else face unenrollment from these courses which he already paid for. This is some of the clearest evidence yet that COVID vaccination mandates are not about public safety. Universities have enormous legal departments and policy teams to consider issues such a student health requirements, so it is highly unlikely that scenarios such as this student’s were not considered and accounted for. The more likely remaining explanation is that the university is aware that students could fall into circumstances such as these and does not care. More precisely, the university is so bent on using COVID vaccination as a sieve to drive away the sort of undesirable (to the elites in whose circles they travel) students who resist the vaccine that they are imposing nonsensical policies. 
2021-10-04;https://twitter.com/kimmiehermann/status/1445172505732435970;In a swift response to school boards’ calls do so, the FBI is now designating parents organizing against radical left curricula in public schools as domestic terrorists. The pretext for this is that threats are being leveled against school board administrators. Given the scale of our nation’s education system, this is undoubtedly true in some cases. But these isolated credible threats can be handled by local law enforcement, as the criminal justice system is designed to do. More importantly, the overarching movement of parents mounting organized political pressure against school boards with radical left curricula should not be branded as “domestic terrorists” based on the actions of a few. That would be the same as branding all of BLM as violent anarchists agitators just because some used summer 2020’s protests as cover for street violence, arson, and looting, which of course the Justice Department nor any law enforcement agency in the country did. Why does BLM, whose protests caused billions of dollars in property damage and killed hundreds of people, not get branded as terrorists but parents with a few bad apples making threats do? Why doesn’t Antifa get branded as terrorists, for that matter? This is rhetorical because the answer is clear: because the left has thoroughly captured all institutions in this country, so that they are empowered to give left-wing extremism a pass while cracking down mercilessly on the faintest whiff of moderate or right organizing. There are no uniform standards anymore—they are all hypocritical double-standards such as these which protect the left and skewer anything to its right. 
2021-10-04;https://twitter.com/johnrobertsFox/status/1445087416612687872;In response to radical far-left immigration activists filming a sitting (Democrat) US senator in a public restroom, Biden, who claims to be champion standing against women’s harassment, said that the actions of of these activists is “part of the process”. Not only is it harassment to film a woman in a restroom, but it is a felony. In this specific case, the felony was recorded on video. That Biden won’t condemn it shows that his protection of women was always a sham. Not only that, but while these activists harass a woman, he is giving a pass to radicals who will stop at nothing to get their policy rammed through. He is caving to the radical left he swore he would be a bulwark against. 
2021-10-05;The online radical-left feminist publication Jezebel, which had initially published an article pleading to spare women and girls from harassment, has now published a piece urging the harassment of Senator Sinema in order to secure their desired radical left outcome. As has proven consistently true across leftist organizations, they have no principles, but contradict any prior principles and issue any double-standards needed to get their preferred policy through. It doesn’t matter to Jezebel that it staked its reputation—indeed, its raison d’etre—on protecting women and girls. Now that they support the activists harassing Sinema to authorize open borders, Jezebel is OK with openly advocating the harassment of women in a public restroom. 
2021-10-06;https://twitter.com/ShantMM/status/1445791375769751552;According to ABC News (widely considered to be credible and fairly unbiased) more Americans have died from COVID in 2021 to date, a year in which vaccination rates reached almost 60% (and so would have had an average rate of 25% to 30% over that time), than had died from COVID in the entirety of 2020, a year which ended with a minuscule percentage of Americans vaccinated. This is yet more proof that the vaccines are not as effective as claimed, and could potentially be putting those who have taken them at grater risk. Many deniers of this contention will claim that the higher death rates are due to the unvaccinated socializing at a dramatically higher rate this year than last year, but this is patently absurd when analyzed in light of the realities of the pandemic. First, all things being equal, the vaccinated and unvaccinated, who transmit COVID at equal rates, are equally likely to socialize now that businesses are open, and a slight majority of people are vaccinated. Vaccination rates have been at or above 50% for most of the time businesses have been reopened. Second, in actual practice, the vaccinated and unvaccinated are NOT equally likely to socialize—here, too, inclination to socialize skews to the vaccinated. Who is more likely to socialize, the person who knows they have no immunological protection against COVID, or those who believe the vaccine makes them invulnerable to COVID? Third, if the unvaccinated were really driving COVID infections, then in countries with no access to vaccines and no lockdowns, we should see roughly double the per-capita rate of COVID infections (because they would have 50% less vaccinated individuals than they would with a vaccine rollout comparable to the US’s). However, this is not what we see: quite the contrary, data shows that COVID infection rates in countries without vaccines is barely worse than that of the US, if not actually LESS than the US’s rate. At a minimum, whether or not majority of 2021 COVID deaths were suffered by the unvaccinated, the majority of cases were spread by the vaccinated. The unvaccinated are also more likely to get tested, since they have no reason to think they won’t get COVID. By contrast, most vaccinated individuals believe it is nearly impossible for them to contract COVID, and so why would they see the need to get tested for COVID? This means that spread among the vaccinated is more likely to go undetected. The picture this paint is clear, and very different from that which is being reported: the vaccinated, impatient to go back to socializing and traveling, selfishly pushed for businesses to open and then spread COVID rampantly, to the detriment of the vaccinated and unvaccinated who then contracted cases. 
2021-10-04;https://twitter.com/townhallcom/status/1445077398576369677;The FBI admitted during a hearing that it doesn’t keep track of violent extremism by leftist groups because it classifies them as “movements” instead of groups. In essence, the FBI plays word games to get out of tracking dangerous far-left groups, but keeps very close watch on far-right groups. As a law enforcement agency, the FBI should be expected to enforce the law, and to do so in an even-handed manner. Violent extremism should be prosecuted regardless of its perpetrator. So why does the FBI go out of its way to classify left extremist groups that engage in violence as “movements” to exempt them from monitoring, but it classifies right extremist groups as groups and therefore tracks them? Every American deserves an answer to that question. While it is only correlation, it would seem that the only distinction is a group’s position on the political spectrum. The FBI’s choice on which groups to classify as groups (to be monitored) and which as movements (to not be monitored) certainly doesn’t have to do with the danger posed by the group, as many far-right groups have perpetrated significantly less violence and destruction than the far-left groups that escape the FBI’s watchful eyes (namely Antifa).

The US war in Afghanistan brought women in the country the most human rights and freedoms that they had ever known. But by sloppily leaving the country and allowing the Taliban to almost immediately take over, the women and girls of Afghanistan will see their rights curtailed as they are forced to adhere to repressive Sharia law. Along with pitiful actions, Biden also exhibited callous words, as his statements to the American people on the withdrawal noted that Americans shouldn’t have to invest tax dollars or soldiers’ lives in helping another country—even a country which we, by our occupation, destabilized. This is supremely ironic considering that, of his many charges against Trump, Biden condemned Trump’s “isolationist” foreign policy. Truly, then, the ambassador is making a fair accusation in stating that Biden doesn’t care about the millions of women and girls who will live under true patriarchal oppression, the likes of which feminist activists in the US couldn’t possibly fathom. 
2021-10-07;https://twitter.com/JesseKellyDC/status/1446211673375793153;Biden states a blatant lie about COVID transmission, flying in the face of his own CDC’s expert assessment, to push for Americans to vaccinate. In a speech, Biden claimed that healthcare workers should be forced to be vaccinated for COVID so that patients won’t catch COVID from them. However, as the CDC and dataset after dataset show, the vaccinated and unvaccinated transmit COVID at the same rates. It should be inconceivable that a president would flagrantly contradict his own experts—in fact, the Democrats ruthlessly criticize Trump for exactly this, not always unfairly—and yet Biden has done so at a time when, as he and many fellow Democrats say, COVID misinformation can cause harm. So why did he say it? How was it even possible for him to say it? It would seem that pushing the vaccine on every American is of such a high priority that facts may be dismissed. How can anyone trust anything Biden or his administration say if they are willing to tell lies to advance public health policies which touch the lives of hundreds of millions of Americans?

The FBI has investigated the Capitol Riots with ruthless thoroughness, and appears to have had informants among the rioters, and even they do not seem to believe that anything even remotely resembling a coup took place that day. There was no trace of intent to overthrow the government. The fact that so few rioters had, and none used, lethal weapons weapons when they very well could have is reason enough to prove that January 6 was not a coup. But the left-wing pundits are definitively labeling January 6 a coup, and using it to justify the political repression of anyone who disagrees with them. This is flatly the behavior of fascists. Only totalitarian and authoritarian thugs brand their opposition as extremists to be barred from political life without exception. And yet they have the audacity to declare Republicans and their voters, who never moved to bar the Democrats from politics as the Democrats are Republicans, as the authoritarians. The audacity of this psychological projection is breathtaking.

If the Republicans were as profoundly racist as the Democrats allege, this should not be possible—this shouldn’t even be a remote concern. This polling comes on the heels of the 2020 election in which Trump received more votes from nonwhite voters, in both absolute terms and percentage terms, than he did in 2016, cementing the trend of the flight of nonwhite voters from the Democratic Party. Add to this the fact that Biden carried Georgia due to overwhelmingly affluent white Atlanta suburbs, the fact that more Big Tech employees and wealthy Americans donate to the Democratic Party than the Republican Party by enormous margins, and the fact that most elite institutions (including universities) are skewed far to the left, the Democrats have completed their transformation into the party of the rich elites.

Rogan points out that his ivermectin regimen was prescribed to him by a doctor, that it was dosed appropriately for humans, and that ivermectin was discovered and intended for use in humans first and foremost. It was only after repeated questioning that Gupta, a CNN contributor and licensed physician, admitted that CNN should not have lied in construing Rogan’s medical treatment as it did: as taking animal medicine when he clearly took human medicine. What’s worse, though, is that upon being questioned, Gupta admitted that he never raised any concern with CNN’s editorial staff that they were advancing this utter lie to their viewership, as any responsible journalist should be expected to do. Instead, Gupta was complicit in the lie by recognizing it (especially as a medical professional with the unique expertise to do so) and refusing to denounce it privately (at CNN) or publicly until pressed by the victim of the lie. In this, evidence only continues to mount that mainstream, overwhelmingly pro-left, media is not interested in communicating the truth about COVID, but rather the officially sanctioned (by the Democrats) narrative, even when that narrative is false.

Typically, harsh detainment conditions are reserved only for those convicted of a crime in a court of law before a jury. Even in these cases, Democrats have historically taken the position that solitary confinement is never justified and constitutes a violation of the Eighth Amendment’s proscription of “cruel and unusual punishment”. However, with the exception of Senator Warren, Democrats are content to inflict what they themselves define as “cruel and unusual punishment” on January 6 defendants before they even appear in court. This kind of behavior, the brutal suppression of political opponents, is the hallmark of authoritarianism, and proves the Democrats to be the very despotic tyrants they claim to stand against.

All the FOP is asking for is for the city to allow its members to have the autonomy to choose their own medical treatments, as most other Americans are allowed to do. CPD officers who decline to be vaccinated would likely be amenable to weekly COVID testing as an alternative. But the Democrat-controlled city is so dead-set on requiring COVID vaccinations that it is not willing to accept this compromise, even if it results in a dangerous deficit in law enforcement that is guaranteed to result in dramatic spikes in crime. How can Chicago Democrats justify forcing law enforcement to vaccinate against a disease which kills only 0.03% of its victims at the inescapable cost of homicide rates spiking at a time when crime is already at a 2-decade high? How is that even remotely a rational position to take, especially when the vaccinated and unvaccinated spread COVID at the same rate? Democrats have an irrational obsession with getting everyone vaccinated against a minimally lethal disease, an obsession which is so stubborn and all-consuming as to be suspicious.

During a Senate hearing, Senator Paul asked Fuaci if the NIH funded gain of function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology when such funding was against NIH policy at the time, and Fauci insisted that the NIH did not. This document proves that Paul was correct when he stated, during that same hearing, that Fauci’s statements were untrue. What’ s even more interesting—and peculiar, and (potentially) telling—is that while Paul only stated that the NIH under Fauci funded research on gain of function for one species of coronavirus, Fauci leapt to clarify that this could not have been the same coronavirus as COVID-19. No one, neither Paul nor anyone else, had charged that this was the case: Paul merely said that he approved the funding for gain of function research for SOME coronavirus species, of which there are many. Why is Fauci so quick to counter that this researched virus and COVID-19 are not the same when now one was even asking or suggesting that? Does he believe he has to get out in front of something? He was already caught lying—and that’s exactly what it was, lying, because Paul read directly from another document serving as a memorandum of the research in question, reminding Fauci of nature of the research, and Fauci still denied that it was gain of function research. If Fauci was willing to lie once, how much more is he hiding?

Biden centered his candidacy in part on driving greater, more “sustainable” economic growth than Trump, and all the American people have gotten so far is inflation and supply shortages. Even in the darkest days of the pandemic, inflation was not advancing at the runaway pace that it is now. Biden even has the benefit of most businesses in most parts of the country being open, whereas Trump’s last year saw most of the nation shut down, and yet Biden’s economic performance is still significantly worse than Trump’s.

All that has happened instead is a rate of detention that makes Trump look merciful by comparison, and not even the slightest hint of a viable long-term solution. Biden has announced no plans to reform the US immigration system to manage the levels of incoming migrants we are seeing now. It’s just another crisis he is hoping we will all ignore while it fixes itself.

It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to understand that, when vocals sectors of the constituency insist that all cops are violent bigoted thugs and the dominant party in every major city in American either echoes the rhetoric or remains silent, crime rates will spike. The civic climate across the nation is now such that a police officer will be skewered by the public and targeted by prosecutors for even the most eminently justified use of force against a violent perpetrator. So why would a police officer risk their neck and their job to stop violent crime when they can hang back and collect a paycheck by just letting the violence play out? All the cops who would act with force to stop imminent violent criminality have already been asked to resign, resigned in protest, or retired. This leaves only cops who have no integrity, and would rather keep their job and let crime get out of hand then do the right thing. An explosion in the crime rate is the only possible result of all these factors coalescing.

Facebook employees are overwhelmingly aligned with the left and the Democrats, and anyone who looks at the FEC filings for the two parties and their respective candidates for the past two presidential elections will see undeniable proof that this is the case. Knowing the political bent of Facebook on the whole, it easily stands to reason that censorship of political activity will target the right more than the left. And if that wasn’t enough, Democrats in congress keep pushing Facebook and other online platforms to engage in more censorship, implying that the censorship should target the right, under implied threat of regulatory retaliation for failing to do so. Taken together, censorship of the political right to a much higher degree than the left is a virtual certainty.

However, not only are the risks of myocarditis known to be high for adolescent and pre-adolesecent boys, but we still do not know the effects that mRNA will have 5 years out or more on those who receive COVID mRNA therapies. It is simply not worth the lifetime of adverse side effects that the COVID mRNA therapy may cause to protect a child from a disease they probably won’t get and almost certainly won’t die from.

But of course, Trump faced the same pandemic, and when there was neither treatment nor vaccine available, and did not succumb to the inflation we are seeing now. Granted, it may be the case that the effects we are seeing now, such as backlogged ports, take time to manifest by their nature. However, Biden knew the economy he would inherit when he won—the pandemic was not a surprise to him, as it was to Trump—and yet he is still not able to enact stabilizing monetary policy.

In clinical trials, the cheap generic drug fluvoxamine was found to be so clearly effective at “significantly” reducing COVID hospitalization that the trials were ended early. This runs counter to claims by doctors and public health experts that the experimental and never-before-approved mRNA “vaccines” were the safest and only recourse against COViD. These trials strongly suggest that the mRNA vaccines are the riskier choice for stopping COVID in light of a cheaper, well-understood drug with a far longer safety profile, as vaccine skeptics insisted all along. How is it we are only finding out about viable alternatives to the mRNA vaccines now, when we had every reason to follow every lead on possible treatments with repurposed drugs before the vaccines were available? How did it take less time to research and distribute a vaccine with a technology that had never been used in humans before (which, it should be noted, have extraordinarily tricky logistics due to the insanely cold storage temperature they require) than it took to discover that an existing drug could treat COVID? Were doctors not trying repurposed drugs for treating COViD patients before the vaccines came out? Did no one have any idea that this might work? And if they did, how come we didn’t know about this until now? The vaccine skeptics knew about fluvoxamine when the mRNA vaccines first came out. How did no one else? It certainly is convenient for Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson that an effective generic drug treatment for COVID wasn’t discovered until AFTER their expensive newly patented pharmaceuticals could be purchased for billions of dollars by every developed nation in the world.

The mRNA COVID “vaccine” treatment does not reduce one’s chance of spreading the virus, whatever else it DOES do. Those who stubbornly insist that the unvaccinated are the sole or primary culprits for spreading the virus have no leg to stand on scientifically (science being something these people claim to respect as they invoke it).

However, not only did the Wisconsin Elections Commission advise care facility workers that they could vote on behalf of their residents, in violation of state law, but staff in a Racine County nursing home were found to have helped residents vote whom family members say are not cognitively capable of voting. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out which party the Democrat-controlled state government intended nursing home care workers across the state to vote for. But on top of that, the fact that Biden won Wisconsin means that even if election fraud were committed by both sides in equal proportion, more fraudulent votes would be in favor of Democrats. Wisconsin also happens to be one of the handful of states Biden needed to win the election, an election that was closer than Democrats projected, and which they desperately needed to win in order to prevent the disintegration of their party. The evidence only mounts that the Democrats stole the 2020 election—it’s not definitively proven yet, but the election’s integrity is only put further into doubt the closer one looks. 
2021-10-31;https://taibbi.substack.com/p/the-lets-go-brandon-freakout-goes;The same mainstream journalistic outlets that reported the mass calls of “Fuck Trump” with no editorial comment—or even implicit or explicit support—are now vehemently condemning as violent extremism the peaceful (if crude) “Let’s go Brandon” euphemism for “Fuck Joe Biden”. Once again, the double-standard on public discourse skews in favor of the Democrats, with the help of the Democrats’ steadfast allies, the media. By the rules of public discourse which the Democrats have decreed, it’s okay to exclaim “Fuck Trump”, but it is un-American, dangerous, and verging on criminal to say “Fuck Joe Biden”, or even the PG meme-created innuendo “Let’s go Brandon”. The media pro-Democrat commentators who are pushing this line reason that, because Trump supposedly attempted to “overthrow” our democracy, voicing any support for him should be seen as treasonous. What these journalists are too dim-witted and pathetically, sycophantically partisan to understand, though, is that expressing disapproval of Biden is NOT the same as expressing approval for Trump. One can very well be angry at Biden’s leadership and still not support Trump. But this is worse than the stupidity of the journalists who advance this line: they are setting two very alarming precedents. First, they are equating dissent against Biden with support for Trump. Second, and more concerning, they are equating disapproval of a president with treasonous acts against the country. This is the stuff that authoritarian dictatorships are made of. It is only the likes of Putin’s Russia, Xi’s China, and Kim’s North Korea that regard expressions of dislike of the government or its leadership as treasonous. Does this really not alarm Americans? This is not a matter of supporting Democrat or Republican, but of standing by principles of Freedom of Speech. The Democrats are so bent on total domination over the government and society that they are willing to violate and abrogate the First Amendment to quell any dissent. 
2021-10-31;https://twitter.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1454883956260622339;Despite social media censoring (nearly) all reference to it and the media painting it as unsafe, ivermectin has now been shown to be effective in treating COVID in 126 studies conducted by scientists around the globe. These studies have shown a correlation between ivermectin and improvement in large percentages of COVID cases with a p value of less than 0.0001, which is an extremely sound experimental threshold (scientific papers are routinely published with p values 100 times higher, meaning 100 times less chance that a correlative relationship exists and is not the result of chance). When will public health officials, the media, and social networks admit that ivermectin very  well may work to treat COViD, and begin changing their guidance accordingly?
2021-10-31;https://twitter.com/RWMaloneMD/status/1454885637924921348;A new study shows that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, the one that the mRNA “vaccine” therapies instruct all the cells in your body to produce, hinders the body’s ability to repair damaged DNA. Earlier studies already determined that the spike proteins were cytotoxic, which explained the range of adverse reactions mRNA COVID therapy recipients experienced. This is yet further evidence that there are real dangers posed by a treatment which involves the body producing spike proteins within itself. DNA repair is how the body prevents the production of cancer tissue: cancer cells are the result of cells with damaged DNA reproducing, creating cells which deviate from the DNA required to perform its intended cellular function. If DNA repair is impaired, the chance of developing cancer tissue is elevated. This is especially concerning since the spike protein production seems to concentrate in the bone marrow and ovaries.

2021-11-02;https://www.instagram.com/tv/CVyhDeIhW1-/;A physician lays out all the data illustrating that the COVID mRNA “vaccines” are, for the population at large, more dangerous than COVID itself. This staggering compilation of evidence serves as the richest single repository of clear, unbiased data on the mRNA therapies for COVID. Here are some highlights among the many points made. (1) He points out that VAERS data is likely reliable, and not the easily gamed system “vaccine” apologists claim it is. Submitting false VAERS data is against the law, and published VAERS data is vetted by the CDC. Even so, the CDC still let significant data accumulate suggesting that the mRNA treatments had an extremely high rate of adverse reactions before shutting VAERS for new submissions on the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. (2) Although available studies have small sample sizes, results do not conclusively show that deaths from the vaccine are less than deaths from COVID. This is particularly apparent when analyzing data on “unblinding”, when study participants are told whether they received the placebo or the real dose and are offered the chance to take the latter if they were in the former group. (3) COVID deaths are over-reported, as any death within 28 days of a positive COVID test result were classified as a COVID death by the CDC. (4) Deaths associated with the “vaccine” overwhelmingly took place within 24 hours after the administration of a dose. The case this physician makes is more sober than most vaccine opponents. It is NOT a case arguing that the vaccines don’t reduce severity of symptoms and chance of hospitalization of those who take it and have mild to no adverse reaction. It appears that the vaccine has exactly the intended effect for most people who take it. However, what he IS arguing is that so many people are having severe adverse reactions that COVID would have killed as many people, if not less, than the vaccines did in the worst cases. 
2021-11-02;https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/03/cisco_updates_covid_19_vaccination_policy/;Democrat-loyal private sector companies continue to push the envelope into how aggressively they can mandate vaccines, with one tech company now requiring vaccinations for their remote workers as well as in-person ones. There is literally no safety benefit to vaccinating remote workers (even assuming the vaccine had a more typical rate of adverse events instead of the highly elevated rate it actually has). So why are they doing it? Clearly, they are trying to win the praise of their Democrats political donation recipients and customers. Recall that tech workers overwhelmingly vote and donate Democrat, so this is not speculation. 
2021-11-03;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1455884701776977924;Despite the fact that Republicans elected the first black woman to be Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, and the first Latina woman to be Virginia Attorney General, the Democrat-subservient media almost entirely glossed over these accomplishments because it didn’t fit the Democrats’ identity politics narrative insisting the Republicans are irredeemably and wholly racist. The Democrat criticisms of the diverse array of Republican victors still focused on supposed Republican racism. In fact, the black woman making history as Virginia’s Lieutenant Governor, Winsome Sears, made the point explicitly that she has run against actual white supremacists, suggesting that it is unlikely she would align with those same bigots, to put it mildly. This proves how profoundly racist the Democrats are. They use race as a political prop to win elections, and don’t really believe in winning true victories for racial minorities. If they did, they would applaud these landmarks in the state’s history even as they mourned their own electoral loss. But race only matters to the Democrats when it gets them elected. This is even more ironic given that their donor base is overwhelmingly rich white suburbanites. It is now irrefutably clear that Democrats’ charges of racism are entirely psychological projection, and that they are the true racists, as they have always been as a party.

Democrats are, of course, writing this off as right-wing parents turning out in droves. But this does not seem likely. If they are winning, it could equally well be because they are winning the hearts and minds of independents—left-wing parents who want to stem the tide of the right-wing backlash against CRT are just as likely to turn out in force as right-wing parents riled up by CRT. Moreover, school boards already pose a home field advantage to Democrats. The biggest school districts are in the big cities, which are already Democrat strongholds. The overwhelming majority of workers in education are also left-wing, a political alignment which would also apply to school boards. So if anything, the fact that Republicans are STILL winning in spite of the uphill battle means that they are really getting through to voters in the community to take CRT for the serious threat to children’s unbiased education that it is.

2021-11-06;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-59194421;A US federal appeals court has issued an injunction to halt the Biden executive order to enforce a COVID vaccine mandate in private sector companies. From a purely constitutional point of view, this was the only appropriate call for the courts to make. Regardless of what one thinks about the public health merits of a COVID vaccine mandate, it is simply beyond the bound of constitutional authority for the federal government to coerce private sector workers into medical treatment, even if there are alternatives. The Founders would surely be aghast at the idea of forcing Americans to take a drug they do not want, no matter how dire the risk otherwise (and certainly not for a risk as minuscule as COVID, as it is nowhere near the most deadly communicable disease). 
2021-11-09;https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1457826114198544391;Despite a federal appeals court halting the enforcement of Biden’s COVID vaccine mandate for private-sector workers, on the grounds that it may be unconstitutional, Biden has instructed companies to flagrantly disregard the court and go ahead with the mandate anyway. This is the executive branch ignoring the judicial branch of government in regards to one of the most sweeping coercive orders a president has issued since Japanese Internment. If Trump did this, the media would condemnation would be swift and relentless—as it should be for any president overriding a check and balance like this. But because the media are just the Democrats’ bootlickers, they are barely giving this any attention, and those that are have not struck any kind of adversarial tone. Allowing actions like this to pass unremarked is how republics decay into authoritarian states, but because the would-be autocrats are Democrats, the media mostly doesn’t care, and even furthers the erosion of liberal democratic norms if it advances their mutual interests. Few things are more dangerous than the chief executive advocating the defiance of the courts on an order that forces Americans to inject themselves with a substance against their will—and the testing alternative is not sufficient to avoid the order being coercive, as tests are in short supply and not universally or uniformly available.

2021-11-10;https://www.axios.com/blinken-russia-ukraine-invasion-9326ddde-cbb5-4d17-b364-d127b3890579.html;Completely out of the blue, the Biden administration is warning Russia against further incursions into Ukraine, which even the supposedly Russia-friendly Trump administration didn’t feel compelled to do. Recall that Russia’s seizure of Crimea occurred while Biden was Vice President under Obama, and was met by the US with only the most cursory scolding rather than any kind of firm response. It was precisely because Putin sensed weakness from the US administration in 2014 that he attacked then, and it will be because of sensed weakness that Putin would do so again. Trump was panned for being “friendly” toward Russia, yet nothing like an invasion of a Russian neighbor occurred under Trump’s watch. In fact, in dropping US opposition to the Nord Stream 2 pipeline from Russia to Germany, Biden has already granted Russia a bigger boon than Trump ever did. This is yet another classic example of Democrats’ psychological projection, charging the Republicans with Democrats’ own failings. 
2021-11-10;https://twitter.com/stclairashley/status/1458528062870544394;A post on Instagram expressing sympathy for Kyle Rittenhouse’s pain as took the stand in his own trial was removed because it supposedly promoted violence. There is nothing violent about showing sympathy for someone whose freedom may be deprived for their entire life. In fact, I am sure people have done this for other defendants in criminal trials for violent offenses, and their posts have largely not been censored—one can have sympathy on a human level with a defendant regardless of whether or not they were, in fact, guilty of any violent crime. It is natural to feel for those who suffer or may soon suffer, irrespective of whether that suffering is deserved. Showing such sympathy is not indicative of inclination toward violence. 
2021-11-10;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1458535946253524998;In light of the facts that they were forced to concede, the prosecution’s case against Kyle Rittenhouse is utterly incoherent. They have had to admit that Rittenhouse spent his time at the riot preceding the attack by attempting to minimize damage to life and property, that he ran away to avoid violent confrontation, that he heard gunshots and was surrounded by attackers, one of whom pointed a firearm at him before he fired his own... and yet the prosecution still insists that Rittenhouse’s goal was to brutally murder protesters. If Rittenhouse wanted to kill protesters, this would be the most roundabout and unnecessarily risk ways of going about it. If this was somehow the case, Rittenhouse put himself in seriously mortal danger before firing, when he could have easily fired on “protesters” from a much safer vantage point far earlier in the night. Rittenhouse’s actions simply do not square with the prosecution’s alleged motive.

The larger share of the left seems incapable of divorcing the BLM protesters in Kenosha from the opportunistic rioters drawn to the protest. Instead of admitting that there was a violent element incidental to but not affiliated with the BLM demonstrators and denouncing it, the left has rallied around them and demonized Rittenhouse? Why would the left do this instead of concede that their protest attracted the dregs of society? The only rational explanation for this is that the left knows that these violent degenerates are not simply an unrelated element that hovers in the vicinity of BLM protests to use them as cover, but are actually a core component of BLM’s organizing. Ejecting and condemning the violent criminals who were present at the BLM protest would have added moral credibility to the movement—it would have shown that they are committed toward true social progress and hold themselves to the highest moral standards. So the fact that the left, in the main, has not done that means that they know they can’t afford to do so without their movement collapsing. What we have here is a tacit admission that the left has a large contingent of miscreants and criminals. 
2021-11-19;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-59356081;Biden expresses disappointment with the jury verdict that acquitted a man (a boy at the time of the incident) who defended his own life from armed violent criminals from who he was fleeing, and who threatened to kill him and physically assaulted him with deadly force. The details of the case are too many to enumerate, but the most relevant ones are as follows. (1) Before the engagement that resulted in the discharge of his firearm, Rittenhouse was fleeing at full speed, attempting to avoid a confrontation entirely. This fulfills self-defense law’s “duty to retreat”: i.e. an individual invoking self-defense must prove they attempted to remove themselves from a scenario in which force would be necessary. (2) Before he was attacked, Rittenhouse heard gunfire mere dozens of feet behind him. Thus, he had every reason to know that deadly weapons were present, and to suspect that they might be used. (3) When Rittenhouse stumbled and fell, the first assailant lunged on to top of him with an object in his hand. As Rittenhouse was fleeing, he began the engagement with his back to his assailant, so he had no way of knowing what the assailant may have been armed with. In a combat scenario, especially for someone without extensive formal training, it is difficult (if not impossible) to quickly assess what weapons are present before countermeasures must be determined  and implemented—countermeasures which may include the application of deadly force. (4) The assailant attempted to seize Rittenhouse’s firearm. In this scenario, one must assume that the firearm would be used against them if successfully seized. There is no rational reason to believe a firearm would be seized and NOT subsequently used against you. (5) A second assailant struck Rittenhouse in the head twice with a skateboard. Blunt force trauma to the head with an object the mass and material composition of a skateboard can very easily be fatal. Rittenhouse would have been within his rights to fire upon this so-armed second assailant even before he was struck, let alone after being struck twice. (6) A third assailant, allegedly intervening to stop someone (Rittenhouse) he deemed to be a mass shooter, approached Rittenhouse, but Rittenhouse tried to assure the assailant that he (Rittenhouse) posed no threat and would not fire so long as he was not harmed or threatened further. Rittenhouse did this by shouting “friendly!” multiple times and indicating via body language that he did not intend to fire. (7) The third assailant testified in court, admitting that he pointed his pistol at Rittenhouse, and that only then did Rittenhouse fire upon him. A fair, critical reading of these facts by a reasonable person could not possibly lead to any other conclusion than that Rittenhouse was justified in shooting the three individuals he shot. If the third assailants claims are true that he acted to stop what he thought was a mass shooting, it would be tragic that a heated misunderstanding led to Rittenhouse firing on a third person, but nonetheless Rittenhouse would still be justified. That Biden can look at these facts and still declare that Rittenhouse was unjustified in firing upon his attackers is to essentially say that Rittenhouse should have let his attackers beat him to death, take his rifle, and possibly shoot him with it (or with the third assailant’s pistol). How can a president in good conscience condemn a child to attack by violent, unhinged criminals? Perhaps it is because he does not want repulse BLM and its supporters, who were invested in a guilty verdict to protect the character of their movement (see above). Biden would rather a child go to prison for decades for saving his own life than to lose the support of BLM, a movement which is essentially the Democratic Party’s shock troops. 
2021-11-19;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1461824481584812037;One favorite argument from the left to justify their vilification of Rittenhouse is that his acquittal owed to being white, and that a black man in his shoes would have been found guilty. But literally decided in court on the same day, a black man who fired at the police who wrongfully stormed his home was acquitted. Not only did a black man not go to prison for firing a gun in self-defense, but he even fired it at law enforcement, and was still acquitted. Also, in Rittenhouse’s case, the jury was very diverse, evenly split between men and women, and including a diverse racial background. And yet they all unanimously voted to acquit—it didn’t even result in a hung jury mistrial.

In essence, she is expressing that because a jury did not find Rittenhouse guilty of murder for killing people who were actively attacking him with deadly force (i.e. exercising self-defense), the innocent victims in Waukesha—victims which included children—deserved to die. It’s hard to think of expressions which are more callous than this. Thankfully, the higher-ups in her party did the right thing in asking her to resign, which she did. But it begs the question: how many more Democrats think and feel as she does, but simply have not expressed it publicly where they would face adverse consequences for it? This is yet another reason why the Democrats are increasingly (and fairly) viewed as out of touch to the sufferings of the average American.

This is a stockpile that is meant to sustain the military in times of dire national emergency, such as attacks on American soil. Yet Biden is using it as a means of cushioning the drop in poll numbers, leaving us less prepared for the most dire threats to our nation. And his is no small withdrawal of oil: Biden is planning on depleting 50 million barrels, which is more than 8% of the total stockpile. This just goes to show how utterly selfish the Democrats are. They will leave America less prepared just to help them in the midterm elections. 
2021-11-24;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/pandemic-skyrockets-in-europe-covid-is-the-no-1-cause-of-death/;COVID cases are spiking in Europe, a region with one of the highest rates of “vaccination” against COVID in the world (if not the highest). The fact that these correlations are playing out over and over again around the world—in Israel and the US, for instance—presents mounting evidence that the mRNA vaccines do not provide protection against contracting COVID, and doesn’t even seem to protect much against severe symptoms and hospitalization. As the virus continues to mutate, how could this not but be expected? The booster shots are not retooled to encode mRNA instructions for any variant spike proteins, but are the same mRNA molecules which encode the wild type (i.e. original strain of SARS-CoV-2) spike proteins. COVID vaccine apologists will no doubt rush to blame the unvaccinated, but that is absurd on its face. Vaccination rates only increase, not decrease. And even if we pretend that the well-established fact that the vaccinated and unvaccinated spread COVID at equal rates is not the case, this would mean that the unvaccinated would have to be engaging in activity which spreads the virus at astronomically higher rates suddenly, which is plainly ridiculous. Not even holiday socializing or the increase in indoor time that comes with dropping seasonal temperatures would be enough to account for this. We are marching steadily closer to the admission that the vaccines do nearly nothing to address COVID, and less all the tie as the virus continues mutating.

What’s worse, Biden is going to spend American tax dollars to offer them vaccines, even when a large proportion of them will have their asylum requests denied and thus never set foot in the US. Biden is faced with managing record numbers of illegal migrants, so the fact that he couldn’t think of anything better means that either he determined that Trump’s approach was actually the best—it is highly unlikely that Trump’s approach was anywhere near to being the best possible solution—or that Biden literally has no ideas for how to address the border crisis. 
2021-11-25;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1463954828749594626;The New York state legislature is introducing a bill which would permit health insurers to deny coverage of COVID treatment for individuals who are not vaccinated with the mRNA COVID “vaccines”. Such legislation would be unprecedented, and goes against our society’s values of bodily and medical autonomy. Insurers are not allowed to deny coverage for gastric bypass surgeries to obese people who don’t exercise. Insurers are not allowed to deny coverage for lung cancer treatment to people who smoke. Yet now Democrats want to deny coverage for people who do not want to inject themselves with a substance that has never been approved for humans before 2020 and which has no safety profile data for any period longer than 2 years? Besides being heartless and authoritarian, the proposal shows how hypocritical Democrats are, since one centerpiece of their Obamacare plan was to outlaw insurers’ discretion to selectively cover patients based on their preexisting conditions. This provision was meant to state that all people deserve coverage. Apparently the Democrats don’t really believe in that—coverage is only for those who submit to the will of the government and receive the treatment they are ordered to receive. Apparently, there is no bottom to the authoritarian depths the Democrats will sink to to enforce their worldview on everyone. 
2021-11-25;https://twitter.com/GBNEWS/status/1463926037889396736;A medical researcher stated that a new study published by his team shows a correlation between the mRNA COVID “vaccine” and a statistically significant rise in the likelihood of cardiac events, including heart attacks. Furthermore, although he was not able to submit proof, the researcher claimed that colleagues at other research institutions discovered findings pointing to the same correlation, but declined to publish the findings because it would result in them losing funding from the pharmaceutical industry. Medical researchers, it would appear, are so beholden to pharma companies for their livelihood that these companies can suppress results that cast doubt on their products. To be clear, although it cannot be proven that results that specifically undermine the safety profile of the mRNA COVID “vaccines” were self-censored for fear of financial retaliation, it cannot be denied that financial links between pharma companies and researchers affords the latter with significant influence over the former. The question is whether this influence was, in fact, wielded in this case, not whether such influence is present. But given how much is riding on the perceived safety of the vaccines, it is very hard to imagine that self-censorship of this kind is NOT going on for fear of losing Pfizer, Moderna, BioNTech, or Johnson & Johnson money. 
2021-11-25;https://twitter.com/ianmSC/status/1463965077875290140;Despite having one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, as well as vaccine passport requirements for visiting bars or attending major public events, Portugal is now seeing such a spike in COVID cases that the government is announcing new public health measures. As almost everyone in the country is vaccinated, this phenomenon cannot be explained by the unvaccinated. Even if one were to concede that unvaccinated travelers may have favored Portugal as a tourist destination (under the perception that it is particularly safe from COVID), there is no way that this occurred at the astronomical rate required to explain the data. As such, the data shatters the myth that only the unvaccinated transmit the coronavirus. The conclusion is inescapable: the vaccine doesn’t stop the spread, and doesn’t prevent symptomatic cases—without symptoms, what reason would a vaccinated individual have to get tested for COVID?
2021-11-25;https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/21/facebook-algorithm-biased-race/;When Facebook’s auto-moderation algorithm operated in a “race-blind” manner, Facebook found that 90% of all “hate speech” on its platform was directed at either white people or men. Essentially, when the algorithm did not account for the identity category (race, sex, sexuality, etc.) of the poster, and purely searched for hateful speech directed at members of another identity category, the identity categories that were targeted 90% of the time were men and/or white people. Granted, it is likely that this figure is SOMEWHAT inflated, since Facebook’s human moderators probably take down hate speech with a prioritization of anti-minority identity category hate speech (i.e. leaving less such speech for the algorithm to automatically remove). However, even if you account for this, it still leaves an overwhelming majority of hate speech directed at white people and men. Once again, the left prove themselves to be egregious culprits of projection: they claim hate speech (presumably by the right) is rampant against their political prop identity categories, yet it is the left that spews the most hate speech, when hate speech is judged objectively as targeting someone for hateful speech solely on their membership of an identity group (even majority groups). But, as has been a fixture of the left since at least the 1960s (see Herbert Marcuse’s idea of “repressive tolerance in “A Critique of Pure Tolerance”), the left has assumed the power to be hateful toward its enemies while decrying hate toward its side. 
2021-11-25;https://twitter.com/InnaVernikov/status/1463575575877070853;The New York City government has proposed a law that would permit non-citizens to vote in municipal elections. Such a measure not only tilts the playing field in favor of Democrats, as Democrats authored this plan and pander to non-citizens (including illegal migrants) the most, but it debases the worth of American citizenship. Immigrants who worked hard to achieve legal citizenship have basically been told that their hard work is worth nothing, that they could have just remained non-citizens and enjoyed all the same rights. But make no mistake: this tactic is about obtaining new sources of electoral support. The New York City measure doesn’t change much in itself—it will introduce new Democrat voters in a municipality that is already a Democrat bastion—but it sets a precedent moving the Overton Window toward granting more non-citizens in more places the right to vote in more elections. It takes little imagination to suspect that Democrats eventually want to allow non-citizens to vote in all elections, notably for the presidency. 
2021-11-27;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1464629976091660290;When Trump closed travel from countries with high COVID infection rates, he was branded as a racist, yet now when Biden closes travel from a number of African countries to forestall the emergence of the Omicron variant, there are no accusations of racism leveled at him. Once again, the left and its media allies work tirelessly to impose double-standards, always to the Democrats’ benefit. 
It should not be controversial to not allow individuals to enter the US from countries that have a dangerous new variant of COVID. However, the fact that Biden, a Democrat, is closing our border to countries where the Omicron variant is present betrays his lack of faith in the “vaccine”. If the mRNA “vaccines” were so effective, and the unvaccinated were so obviously misguided in not taking the “vaccine”, then there would be nothing to fear from the Omicron variant. The Democrats have shown by their actions that they don’t truly care for the safety of the unvaccinated. For one thing, they have reopened restaurants and other places where people socialize, where the vaccinated can go to contract and spread COVID, to the detriment of the vaccinated and unvaccinated alike. For another, voices on the left have pinned the blame for the pandemic entirely on the unvaccinated, and increasingly call on the government to mandate the vaccine and criminalize those who do not comply. So again, if the “vaccine” is so effective and the unvaccinated (in the eyes of many Democrats) should get no sympathy for the COVID risks they run, why is Biden so worried about the Omicron variant making it to the US? ;;2021-11-29;https://www.axios.com/biden-omicron-variant-covid-8577a012-1a4b-4d60-9b4d-1161662eeeaa.html;After his party maintained in 2020 that restrictions on freedom of movement were the only way to stop the spread of COVID, Biden announced that he will not employ any kind of economic shutdowns to combat the Omicron variant. Granted, it is possible that public health experts and leaders have simply analyzed the data and determined that these measures are ineffective. It could also be that there is no political appetite across the political spectrum for more shutdowns. But it could also be that Democrats embraced economic shutdowns in 2020 to crash the economy and make Trump look bad, and now that Biden is in power don’t want to stunt the nation’s economic growth. Regardless, it is interesting that the “do anything it takes to stop COVID” Democrats are taking certain public health measures off the table without anyone really asking, and before the lethality of Omicron is even known with any scientific confidence. 
2021-11-30;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/us-preps-vaccine-contingencies-amid-panic-over-poorly-understood-omicron/;Without warning, and without any substantial amount of data on the Omicron variant, the Biden administration went from only recommending COVID shot boosters for at-risk health groups to recommending it for everyone and preparing an Operation Warp Speed-like push for a new COVID “vaccine” from the pharma giants. As the Delta variant subsides—the last variant that any data suggested was lessened in severity by the COVID “vaccines”—and Omicron takes over, there is no data that shows that the current COVID “vaccines” are effective, and yet Biden is advocating we all get boosters for it. How does this make sense? How is this a justified expenditure of tax dollars? It’s also egregiously hypocritical that the Democrats went from criticizing Trump’s Operation Warp Speed accelerated vaccine development as reckless, to pushing the products of that initiative (the COVID “vaccines”) on everyone, to preparing to roll out a new iteration of Operation Warp Speed. Regardless, the main point at issue here is that Democrats have quickly gone from assuring Americans that we won’t have to get booster shots for COVID every 6 months forever, to mandating a 3rd shot and preparing a 4th shot. It sure doesn’t look like the Democrats think we can stop taking COVID shots.

If the vaccine is supposedly so effective and if supposedly only the unvaccinated spread COVID—as so many on the cultural left continue to believe and Democratic officials continue to suggest via their statements—why is Biden making the vaccinated get tested? This new policy strongly suggests that Biden and the Democrats know deep down that the “vaccine” doesn’t stop inoculation and transmission of COVID, but have pretended otherwise so they can push the vaccine on more people. Biden and his Democrat allies could have marketed the vaccine as solely reducing the severity of COVID, which the data still supports. That would likely have been enticing enough of a prospect to drive vaccination, if that’s what the Democrats sincerely thought was best. But instead, they disseminated lies about only unvaccinated people spreading COVID when the data has shown the whole time that the vaccinated spread COVID just as much. 
2021-12-01;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-59486397;In announcing the reversal of its policy of suppressing posts about Kyle Rittenhouse, Facebook has admitted that it HAD a policy of suppressing these posts, proving yet again that it is a willing and enthusiastic agent of state censorship—if only by anticipating the state’s (the Democrat establishment state’s) political messaging desires. There is no justification for suppressing the story of a major court case being decided against the interests of the left. But Facebook did so anyway, depriving its users of one of the largest forums for discussing a socially, culturally, and politically significant development. These significances are also almost entirely driven by the left, so the fact that Facebook caved to the left’s decree that the Rittenhouse case not be discussed in any way but in condemnation shows that Facebook is an agent of the left.

Vaccination levels in Illinois are the highest they’ve ever been, and yet COVID levels are also the highest they’ve ever been. If the vaccines are so effective, how come there are more cases when vaccination rates are at 61% than there were when vaccination rates were less than 25% (in January 2021, coming right off of the 2020 holiday gathering season)?
2021-12-06;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59552524;Even after Biden’s order mandating the COVID shot for employees of large private sector companies was halted in federal court, New York City is still pressing forward with its own mandate for private sector employees.

2021-12-07;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1468211349155110918;Journalists are tripping over themselves to come up with new terms to facilitate and encourage the social shunning of anyone who does not conform to government decrees on the medical treatments citizens should undergo. A prominent media outlet published a think-piece introducing the term “unboosted”, and implying rhetorically that families should not allow those who have not received a booster shot of the mRNA anti-COVID gene therapy into their social gatherings. This is to essentially erode the bodily autonomy and medical self-determination by hanging social exile over the heads of family members. This is a classic trapping of totalitarian regimes: making families the instrument of state political dogmas. It is the government, first and foremost, which pushes citizens to be vaccinated. The government deputizing family members to pressure one another to receive more doses of a medical treatment dissolves the line between the state and the family—if the family cannot resist the state, what could possibly be safe from the state? And journalists, whose chief duty should be to challenge dangerous precedents like this, is only too eager to enable them.

When the press stops holding the government accountable, the latter has free rein to do whatever it wants and the people will never know.

This is too frequent, regular, and consistent to require any more to be said about this. The left is reaping what they sow, and this time the taking poor, vulnerable racial minority communities they claim to protect down with them. Logan Square is (in addition to being populated by young, affluent white people) home to a large Latino community, and these people are now paying the price for the left’s stubborn and ignorant virtue signaling.

How does that make even the remotest sense? If the vaccine didn’t prevent their colleague from catching COVID and dying from it, what good will getting more people vaccinated do? If their vaccinated colleague could catch COVID in the first place, it means that they can spread it, which means any vaccinated person could spread it. Prior, ample evidence should already prove this, but these teachers should easily be able to reason this out. Chicago is also one of the more highly vaccinated regions of the country. So, where do these teachers think the their colleague got COVID from in the first place? With the vaccinated outnumbering the unvaccinated 3:2 in Chicago, and vaccination having no impact on transmission, it’s more likely that the deceased contracted it from a vaccinated individual than an unvaccinated one. It is incredible that, with this much data, people can still twist the science so egregiously to pin the blame on the unvaccinated for the pandemic’s continued ravages. 
2021-12-07;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/12/07/chicago-might-require-vaccination-proof-at-more-spots-as-city-hit-by-winter-surge-of-covid-19/;This is essentially more proof of the warping of the science to fit the narrative that the unvaccinated are the cause of the pandemic’s continuation, as shown in the audacious reaction to a CPS teacher’s death and the fact that no one on the left can explain why COVID rates are at their highest at the same time as vaccination rates are also at their highest in Illinois. The data on current COVID infections in Illinois coinciding with the highest rates of vaccination—higher COVID rates even than the fallout from the holidays a year ago when almost no one was vaccinated—should conclusively demonstrate that restricting the unvaccinated more will have no effect on the pandemic. If trends in Europe are any indication, new restrictions will be imposed on the unvaccinated, so what will the leftist vaccine tyrants do when the pandemic still doesn’t ease up? 
2021-12-07;https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/12/willfully-unvaccinated-should-pay-100-of-covid-hospital-bills-lawmaker-says/;In the most serious attempt yet to undermine bodily autonomy and very principle of the Hippocratic Oath, members of Congress are now introducing legislation to deny insurance coverage for COVID-related treatments for the unvaccinated. Nothing like this has ever been tolerated in our society. We don’t deny lung cancer treatment to smokers. We don’t deny gastric bypasses to overweight people who refuse to diet and exercise. People are ultimately allowed to make free choices and expect medical treatment. In the case of the mRNA COVID gene therapies, which have no long-term safety profile and a mountain of evidence suggesting harms, it is much more understandable to decline the vaccine than for smokers to continue smoking or overweight individuals not to diet or exercise. The left is, apparently, this desperate to impose its will on the dissenters—the same left that vehemently insisted that everyone deserves treatment in their passage of Obamacare doesn’t think you deserve medical treatment if you don’t submit to their decreed treatments. 
2021-12-08;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1468650835810955269;A Washington Post reporter breathlessly condemned Fox News for comparing Fauci to a Nazi doctor, audaciously hypocritical considering that in the final year of Trump’s presidency her paper justified characterizing Trump’s presidency as meriting comparisons to the Nazis. It’s bad enough hat her argument upholds the double-standard in which the culturally ascendant left has appointed itself the arbiter of the rules of civility, but does not hold itself to its own rules. But even worse, Biden’s policies are, at best, no better than the Trump policies that this journalist’s media outlet declared were the stuff of Nazi Germany. Trump’s presidency never moved to censor anyone, and in fact endured week after week of protest. Trump’s presidency never coerced (via social ostracism) or outright mandated citizens into taking a medical treatment against their will (namely, the COVID mRNA “vaccine”). Trump’s presidency never dictated what language citizens were required to use, under penalty of the loss of one’s financial means. THESE, from which Trump refrained, are the stuff of true authoritarianism, and the very substance of Biden’s policies. If (IF) either president is deserving of Nazi comparisons, it is Biden. 
2021-12-10;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-59599142;A Chicago jury found actor Jussie Smollett guilty of orchestrating a hate crime hoax attack on himself. Chicago is one of the most liberal places in America, so the fact that a jury there handed down a guilty verdict means that the evidence that the attack was a fraud was likely extremely compelling. Moreover, the left contended that hate crimes were commonplace during the Trump presidency. But if that was actually the case, why did a leftist actor feel compelled to fabricate an attack? If what the left claimed was true, there should have been no shortage of hate crimes, and it would have been clear to all by available data that hate crimes were rampant. 
2021-12-10;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/12/10/aldermen-push-for-new-york-style-vaccine-requirement-in-restaurants-other-public-spaces/;Chicago is going forward with a plan to exclude the unvaccinated from public places to fight the spread of COVID, despite the fact that people spread COVID regardless of vaccination. The fact that vaccination rates are at their highest in the city and COVID rates are still spiking should further prove that shunning the unvaccinated, relegating them to effective lockdown, will not stem the rise in case rates, either. There is no way that the Democrat rulers of Chicago don’t know this, so the fact that they are going to bar the unvaccinated from public anyway means that they are engaging in naked coercion. It’s not about saving lives, it’s not about stopping the spread. It’s not even about protecting the economy—at a 60% vaccination rate, that means that businesses will see a 40% drop in customers. It’s just about Democrats making their political opponents bow to them and their authority.

Not long ago, medical researchers indicated that a fourth dose would be overkill, and now Biden and Big Pharma are working hand-in-hand to incept the idea in citizens that there will come a day when a fourth dose of COVID mRNA gene therapy will be needed to fight COVID. The progression has been as predictable as COVID “vaccine” skeptics predicted: first we were assured that only two doses were needed and everything would be normal again, then a third dose became an unfortunate necessity but we’d finally be back to normal. Now we’re being psychologically primed for a fourth dose, with the promise that THIS time it will finally bring everything back to normal. How many more doses will people take on the promise “returning to normal” before they realize that they’re being sold a bill of goods?
2021-12-12;https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/01/15/understand-trumps-support-we-must-think-terms-multiracial-whiteness/;In order to explain and dismiss the many non-white people, particularly Latinos, who support Trump, leftists are classifying now whiteness as “multiracial” so that it encompasses anyone of any race who just doesn’t support the left. This is the classic leftist play of moving the goalposts when they are losing with the current goalposts. When they couldn’t pin Trump’s support solely on white people, they made up a new term that contradicts every other principle espoused by Identity Politics and Critical Race Theory to explain why a large segment of non-white people support Trump. It’s also ironic because this concept, put forwarded by those who claim to be anti-racist, could not be more racist: instead of acknowledging that some non-white people could be opposed to their movement, they basically alienate these non-white people from their race. In other words, leftists take it upon themselves to invalidate the races of non-white people who don’t support the left, and reclassify these non-white people as white. This is an idea that says that non-white people are too stupid to have their own valid reasons to not support the left, and that they shouldn’t count as non-white unless they are also leftist.

This incident should put to rest, once and for all, the still somehow commonly circulating myth (among the left) that the vaccinated can’t get COVID. Moreover, if some of the healthiest people in our society, professional athletes, can catch COVID in spite of vaccination—in some cases at 3 doses—then how does anyone else expect the vaccines to protect them against COVID cases? How effective are the vaccines really? The only claim about the vaccines that the data can support is that COVID symptoms are typically less severe in the vaccinated versus unvaccinated. 
It’s interesting that this development played out just as the City of Chicago is considering requiring vaccination to visit any indoor public spaces, with the stated rationale being to stop the spread of cases. Does the case of the Chicago Bulls’ COVID outbreak not illustrate that vaccination does not preclude spread? All that a vaccine requirement would do is exclude the unvaccinated from society. Does Lightfoot envision herself as protecting the unvaccinated from themselves? Considering that she views the unvaccinated as the cause of the pandemic’s continuation, this seems unlikely. The only reasonable explanation is that Chicago Democrats want to use social ostracism as a pressure to submit to vaccination, which will enrich pharma stockholding Democrats and their Big Pharma donors.

This is exactly what I, and anyone who understands even the most elementary principles of game theory, predicted would happen. The same people who claim to care the most about black people are the same people who are hiring armed security which will only exacerbate the plight of black people. Armed private security is not bound by the constitution, Justice Department civil rights policies, or any other protections to prevent the racist administration of criminal justice. Armed private security also does not have the extensive training of law enforcement, such as anti-bias training. As such, the security personnel in this neighborhood is free to racially profile with no consequences. And they likely will. The fact that this prediction came true, because affluent mostly-white people are more concerned about their property than about their progressive ideals, shows that the Democrats’ commitment to racial justice is a complete scam. It’s worse than a scam: their professed commitment to racial justice is itself racist, because it uses black people to secure the political objectives of rich whites. Specifically, rich white people (actually, the rich of any race) don’t like the fact that most of their law enforcement tax dollars go to police protecting poor racial minority neighborhoods. If the police budget goes down, rich Democrats can spend their money on private security instead, private security which only protects their neighborhoods. Black people are being used by the Democrats, and this is just another piece of evidence. 
2021-12-15;https://twitter.com/redsteeze/status/1471134898039701510;Twitter announced it will censor users who state that the vaccinated can spread COVID, which multiple studies, public health data, and even the CDC itself maintain is true. This is straight-up Orwellian suppression of the truth. As a private company, Twitter doesn’t truly care what anyone believes or says on its platform, as long as it makes money (i.e. as long as people use its platform). It only applies moderation policies when not doing so would lose them more users than doing so. So the fact that they are censoring the expression of the actual scientific fact that the vaccinated also spread COVID means that it is in someone’s interest. Whose interest? Not the Republicans’. Which party did Twitter aid by suppressing a story that damaged the reputation of one of its candidates in the 2020 election? Which party is the one pushing vaccine requirements to visit public places, under the premise that it’s the unvaccinated that spread COVID? The Democrats. Seems pretty clear that this authoritarian suppression of the truth is meant to help the Democrats.

How could this be possible unless the vaccinated also spread COVID (a fact which Democrats still deny in spite of studies and data like this that clearly prove it)? What makes more sense? Is it that millions of unvaccinated New Yorkers are all getting fake vaccine cards and then socializing 5 times as much as vaccinated New Yorkers? Are unvaccinated New Yorkers all throwing 5 times as many huge house parties as vaccinated New Yorkers? Or is it that the vaccines just don’t stop the spread like multiple studies and data like this indicate? And again, if the vaccine doesn’t stop the spread, which New York leaders (all Democrats) MUST know from their public health advisors, then why are they excluding the unvaccinated from society? It can’t be for public health—unless they really just wanted to protect the unvaccinated from themselves, which seems unlikely because they blame the unvaccinated for the pandemic’s continuation. Again, the only rational explanation for this policy is that New York Democrats, who probably own stocks in and receive campaign donations from pfizer and Moderna, want to coerce their citizens into enriching Pfizer and Moderna. 
2021-12-19;https://twitter.com/martyrmade/status/1472787438430945280;An official White House statement is worded so divisively, for a president who swore he would be a great unifier after Trump’s “divisive” term, that it essentially absolves the vaccinated of all responsibility for the pandemic’s continuation and dismisses the unvaccinated as being doomed to die (and irresponsibly straining the hospital system in doing so). The statement that Biden’s White House put out could not be more ambivalent and heartless toward the unvaccinated, those who are not medically able to have the mRNA COVID “vaccine”, object to it on religious grounds, have already developed natural immunity to COVID, or simply wish to exercise their right to bodily autonomy as Americans. After declaring that the vaccinated have “done the right thing”, the part of the statement addressing the unvaccinated implies that they have (by contrast) not done the right thing, and will suffer for their choice, not undeservedly as the tone would suggest. This tone makes for one of the most divisive messages a White House has put out in living memory, all to shame the unvaccinated into complying with a vaccine which has not even proven effective at doing what it sets out to do: to prevent cases of COVID.

Apparently the city thinks we can just trust violent offenders to show up to court without being monitored electronically. This, of course, coincides with a project to end cash bail. So, under Chicago’s envisioned model, those who commit violent crimes should be able to leave jail for free, and then not be tracked, before their court date. How does this make any sense? Even if most comply, if even one does not, this poses a risk to the safety of law-abiding citizens.

It is inconceivable that Chicago public health officials are UNAWARE that (1) the vaccinated and unvaccinated both spread COVID and (2) that record COVID cases in New York are coinciding with the vaccine mandate in that city. So the fact that Chicago is going forward with this policy anyway means they purely want to exert control over people, to coerce the unvaccinated into getting vaccinated, robbing the unvaccinated of their freedom until they submit to a medical treatment against their will. A policy advanced under the pretext of stopping the spread when the real science shows that the spread will continue regardless is naked tyranny. On top of that, it will reduce the amount of customers businesses can expect by about 30%, which may be enough to crush many small businesses that didn’t go under during the first two years of the pandemic. The Democrats clearly do not care about science, the economy, or our core civil liberties. They only care about controlling others.

Only in nations like China does the leader dictate what is required to be patriotic, using patriotism as a nationalistic cudgel with which to beat political opponents.

2021-12-23;https://twitter.com/ggreenwald/status/1474098335174774786;Students at Emerson College, who must already be vaccinated with 3 doses to even attend, are required to stay in their rooms for the first 2 weeks they are back on campus. If the vaccines are so effective, how would these measures make any sense? If the vaccines stop the spread, then why are vaccinated and boosted students required to isolate from all but their roommates? And if the vaccines were so effective at reducing symptoms, then what harm is there in letting students go about their lives and take the risk of catching COVID, since it would be a mild case? The only way this “stay in room directive” makes even a shred of sense is if the vaccines aren’t effective—Emerson College clearly seems to believe they aren’t. But at that point, if Emerson has no faith in the vaccine, why don’t they allow the unvaccinated to attend their institution? Upon the harsh scrutiny of critical thought, it becomes clear that these regulations are not about stopping the spread, but about dismissing all unvaccinated people from campus, about ensuring that only the most submissive and obedient to arbitrary public health measures remain. It’s about ensuring that a population is made up only of the docile. 
2021-12-24;https://www.axios.com/cdc-covid-isolation-period-health-care-workers-3d556f37-8a33-4f70-9624-095a58b67906.html, https://www.axios.com/new-york-quarantine-essential-workers-ce732202-5127-468f-904d-1520907b89cb.html;Due to shortages among medical and other “essential workers”, and not because of any new conclusions drawn from medical or public health research, the CDC and New York City are reducing the amount of time which these workers must quarantine after testing positive for COVID. As any thinking person could tell, there is nothing about merely being an “essential worker” that makes you less contagious when you catch COVID compared to a non-essential worker. Yet public health experts are pretending as though they are, as though essential workers don’s spread COVID for as long as non-essential workers, and so can go back to work sooner. As is plain to any rational person, then, this policy change is not grounded in any scientific or factual basis. It is founded only on the practical needs of the CDC and New York City. How, then, do either of these entities expect anyone to trust them to issue objective public health policies? The CDC is the same government body that admitted that it initially dropped the mask mandate for the vaccinated to encourage vaccination, and not because any kind of scientific data suggested that the vaccinated didn’t require masks. Returning to the present incident, though, why ARE the CDC and New York City so hard up for essential workers that they need to relax the public health standards for them? It could be because New York City, despite prohibiting the unvaccinated (for months) from entering indoor public places under the supposed premise that this will stop they spread, is seeing its highest ever COVID rates. In other words, it could be because the vaccines aren’t stopping the spread because COVID rates are at their highest even with the unvaccinated shut in at home (i.e. only the vaccinated are in a position where spreading COVID is even possible). It could also be that numerous health systems around the country fired their unvaccinated workers even though these workers were OK with accepting the risk of working among COVID patients without being vaccinated. Even if health workers are vaccinated at higher rates than the general public, this would still represent a 20% to 25% drop in healthcare work force, a critical shortage which did not have to happen but for arbitrary rules about vaccination. 
2021-12-24;https://www.navy.mil/Press-Office/Press-Releases/display-pressreleases/Article/2883595/uss-milwaukee-remains-in-port-as-sailors-test-positive-for-covid-19/;In case anyone needed any more proof that the mRNA COVID shots prevent neither infection nor spread, a US naval vessel with a 100% vaccinated crew has had to remain in port to quarantine sailors who tested positive for COVID. If the vaccine truly immunized recipients, then these vaccinated sailors would not have caught COVID. And if the vaccinated couldn’t spread COVID, then how is it that multiple sailors have caught COVID? And if the vaccinated can’t spread COVID, why would the Navy require these vaccinated COVID-positive sailors to stay away from their vaccinated fellow sailors? The simplest and most likely explanation is that the vaccine neither prevents a COVID infection nor the spread of COVID to others, even vaccinated others. 
2021-12-26;https://www.deseret.com/coronavirus/2021/12/26/22848390/covid-vaccine-booster-shots-omicron-variant;The CEO of BioNTech, the company that co-developed an mRNA-based COVID shot with Pfizer, declared that now 1 booster is not enough, and that at least 2 would be needed. This statement is only the latest in the gradual desensitization of the public to accepting more and more COVID shots for for, at best, the same efficacy as was promised with the initial 2-shot dose and, at worst, reduced efficacy (in light of COVID variants). How many doses are people going to tolerate, as the number required only continues to increase? How many more promises of efficacy will be casually broken before people realize that the mRNA COVID “vaccines” are not effective? 
2021-12-27;https://www.axios.com/fauci-vaccine-mandate-domestic-flight-coronavirus-f9d7d6bc-1952-4e3f-8aa9-4cd9921f43ec.html;Fauci is now seriously entertaining the idea of barring the unvaccinated from traveling by air, despite studies previously indicating that airplane cabins are among the safest indoor environments from a COVID standpoint and, of course, despite the fact that the vaccinated and unvaccinated both spread COVID roughly equally. This statement does not carve out any alternatives, such as producing a negative COVID test within 72 hours of air travel. Instead, Fauci wants to casually restrict the freedom of movement of the unvaccinated. This is yet further arbitrary limitations on the freedom of the unvaccinated, purely because they refuse to relinquish their bodily autonomy—the right to choose their own medical treatment for their own bodies—and submit to the medical treatment mandated by the government. If this policy is adopted, it can be seen as nothing other than naked tyranny since (1) both the vaccinated and unvaccinated pose a risk of spreading COVID and (2) the risk of spread is low in either case due to the rapid air exchange in airplane cabins. Such a policy would have the compounding effect of making it difficult for the unvaccinated to leave jurisdictions where they are deprived of their freedoms. For instance, there are geographically large blocs of of West Coast and East Coast states that are overwhelmingly Democrat, so anyone seeking to relocate outside of those areas would not be able to do so by air—they would be limited to ground transport only. 
2021-12-27;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-59800114;New York City is further eradicating the bodily autonomy and personal freedoms of its citizens by outright requiring all private employees to be vaccinated to continue to hold their jobs. More tyrannical authoritarian policies can hardly be imagined: surrender your bodily autonomy to receive a medical treatment against your will or become financially destitute. It also makes for idiotic economics. Even if a number of citizens submit, this will still result in the reduction of the city’s workforce by 10% to 20%, a devastating blow to any economy, let alone a concentrated center of GDP like New York City. 
2021-12-27;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/12/27/illinois-increasing-covid-testing-vaccinations-as-state-hit-by-highest-surge-in-cases-from-throughout-pandemic/;Despite having one of the highest COVID vaccination rates in the country, at 72% of citizens having taken at least 1 dose, Illinois is still seeing record high COVID case rates. How could this even be possible if the “vaccine” was effective? If the vaccine was so effective, then all the unvaccinated people—whom are outnumbered by vaccinated people almost 3:1 for 1 dose, 2:1 for 2 doses—would have gotten COVID long before now, and either died or developed natural immunity, leaving no one left to infect. But the fact that there are so many cases now when the supposedly more vulnerable population (unvaccinated) is so much smaller than the supposedly more protected population (vaccinated) means that the vaccine is not that effective. Numerically/statistically it is highly unlikely to be otherwise. And yet Chicago and Cook County are still pushing the vaccine. 
2021-12-28;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59810713;Even more highly vaccinated regions of the world are seeing record high COVID case rates. Again, this is extremely improbable by any other explanation OTHER than the fact that the vaccines are not that effective (at least against the variants) and that the vaccinated and unvaccinated both spread COVID. 
2021-12-29;https://blockclubchicago.org/2021/12/29/everyone-should-get-a-covid-19-test-before-gathering-for-new-years-eve-officials-say/;The mayor of Chicago is recommending that everyone, regardless of whether they are vaccinated against COVID or not, who is celebrating New Years Eve get a COVID test—whether she’s conscious of this or not, she clearly has no real faith in the vaccine. If the vaccine was so effective against COVID, why does EVERY vaccinated person need a test before gathering for the holiday? Why not only recommend those with COVID symptoms or suspected exposure get tested? The only reason to issue a blanket recommendation to get tested, irrespective of the presence of symptoms or vaccination, is if the vaccine is not effective.
2021-12-29;https://twitter.com/JordanUhl/status/1476373240591396865;When Trump was president, the Democrats insisted that every precaution needed to be taken against COVID, even at the expense of the economy, but now that Biden has been president for a year (i.e. it’s been long enough since Trump that people have forgotten) Fauci (so much of a hero among Democrats and their supporters that he’s basically a Democrat) states that quarantine periods for asymptomatic positive COVID tests should be cut  in half “to keep society running”. So, basically, Democrats believe that when Republicans are in power they can destroy the economy to keep us safe from a virus that kills less than 1% of Americans, but when they’re in power we have to take risks and make sacrifices to keep the economy going. Clearly, the Democrats don’t believe in anything except destroying their opponents at all costs, even the economic well-being of the nation.
2021-12-30;https://igorchudov.substack.com/p/9558-of-omicron-in-germany-are-vaccinated;Data from the Robert Koch Institute, the rough equivalent of Germany’s CDC, shows that 95% of Omicron COVID cases are in vaccinated people. If the mRNA COVID “vaccine” was so effective, this should be impossible. Germany has a 70% vaccination rate, and a 38% rate of booster doses, some of the highest rates of vaccination in the world, and yet Omicron cases skew overwhelmingly toward these groups who would, if a functional vaccine were assumed, be least susceptible. Germany has also barred the unvaccinated from most indoor public spaces since the beginning of December 2021, so the only people in a position to spread COVID widely ARE the vaccinated—the unvaccinated could only spread the disease among those in their immediate families, and not to any large groups or to nearly any strangers. How can all this data taken together suggest any other conclusion than that the vaccine does not work? 
2021-12-31;https://greenwald.substack.com/p/new-york-is-using-race-to-determine;New York City is officially prioritizing non-white individuals for monoclonal antibody treatments. Although all individuals (of all races, identity groups, etc.) with comorbidities or other significant health factors will receive priority treatment, being racially non-white (or Latino) will be considered IN ITSELF to be a significant health factor even in the absence of any physiological or medical health factors. As Greenwald points out, under New York City’s policy, an athletic upper-class black person would get priority whereas a poor white person (with no chronic health conditions) would not. It is hard to characterize this as anything other than outright discrimination against white people. What’s more interesting is that, the CDC documents cited to justify this policy list lower rates of vaccination as a reason why non-white patients are more vulnerable (and thus deserving of the limited high-quality treatment) event though New York City, by its own vaccine mandate policy, is signaling that the unvaccinated are the problem and should be shamed and shunned into compliance. In other words, in the eyes of the Democrats who crafted New York’s policy, low vaccination rates evidence injustice and justify preferential treatment when the unvaccinated aren’t white, but when the unvaccinated are white, low vaccination is a sign of selfishness and should be met with severe social penalties (i.e. ostracism).
